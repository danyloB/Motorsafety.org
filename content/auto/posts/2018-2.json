Mitsubishi launched an investigation and found that the windshield wiper ball joint on the vehicle had corroded but was unable to pinpoint the root cause of the oxidization. Between March 2010 and September 2015, the automotive company monitored the field for similar incidents. Over this time, the company received 10 reports mentioning corroded wiper ball joints.</p>\n<p>In February 2015, Mitsubishi received another field report referencing the problem, which had caused the complete loss of windshield wiper functionality. Engineers conducted additional environmental tests in an effort to replicate the problem but could not do so. This led them to assume that the corrosion was a result of high-pressure washing. Mitsubishi continued the limited monitoring program through September 2016. During this time, the company conducted laboratory tests that revealed the front deck garnishes on the Outlander Sport may degrade over time, leading to moisture penetration in the vicinity of the windshield wiper ball joint. This finding led Mitsubishi to conduct a voluntary recall in October 2016 that applied to stock Outlander models and excluded the Sport variation.</p>\n<p>In November 2017, the automaker began field monitoring for the Outlander Sport. Mitsubishi received some reports related to the Outlander Sport over this time but the claim rate failed to surpass that of the stock model. Nevertheless, the automotive company decided to conduct a voluntary recall Feb. 2, 2018, to reduce the likelihood of harm to drivers. Dealers received official notification Feb. 23, 2018.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Mitsubishi has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V103-4895.pdf\">replace the windshield wiper rods</a> and motor crank arms in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgment document.

Specifically, the plastic housing surrounding the BTSI components swells in high temperatures and causes the locking pin to remain in open position. When this occurs, drivers are free to shift the vehicle transmission out of park without depressing the brake pedal or even switching on the car. This defect poses increases the likelihood of unintended rollaway and therefore poses a serious threat to occupants. However, FCA has not received reports linking the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>The FCA&nbsp;Vehicle Regulations Committee on Dec. 8, 2017,&nbsp;requested an internal investigation into vehicles produced after Dec. 31, 2016, suspecting that some may suffer from mechanical flaws. Roughly one month later, engineering personnel tested a BTSI solenoid by heating in an oven set to 170 degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit. The component reached 250 degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit within five minutes, indicating that problems could development in real-world operational environments. Soon after, members of the VRC requested insight into the production processes behind the development of the BTSI housing and pin components. FCA engineers looked into the matter and found that the fabrication process had remained consistent prior to and following Dec. 31, 2016.</p>\n<p>The VRC continued to investigate the matter throughout January 2018, opening a nationwide field review and repair order search. The latter effort yielded three reports that referenced vehicles that suffered BTSI failure and were produced after Dec. 31, 2016. Owners reported being able to shift out of park without pressing the brake pedal or turning the ignition. On Jan. 26, 2018, the VRC found two additional field reports outlining the same issue.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 1, 2018, the VRC decided that a voluntary safety recall was required.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA is currently working on a mechanical remedy, which it will offer free of charge through an owner reimbursement program.

The campaign affects multiple vehicles, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2017-2018 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup trucks produced between Jan. 1, 2017, and Jan. 13, 2018.</li>\n<li>2017-2018 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup trucks produced between Jan. 1, 2017, and Jan. 10, 2018.</li>\n<li>2017-2018 Dodge Ram 3500 pickup trucks produced between Jan. 1, 2017, and Jan. 24, 2018.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FCA suspects 3 percent of the models referenced in the recall actually contain the defective components.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles, all of which feature column gear shifting assemblies, come with BTSI systems that prone to dysfunction after long periods of use. Specifically, the plastic housing surrounding the BTSI components swells in high temperatures and causes the locking pin to remain in open position. When this occurs, drivers are free to shift the vehicle transmission out of park without depressing the brake pedal or even switching on the car. This defect poses increases the likelihood of unintended rollaway and therefore poses a serious threat to occupants. However, FCA has not received reports linking the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>The FCA&nbsp;Vehicle Regulations Committee on Dec. 8, 2017,&nbsp;requested an internal investigation into vehicles produced after Dec. 31, 2016, suspecting that some may suffer from mechanical flaws. Roughly one month later, engineering personnel tested a BTSI solenoid by heating in an oven set to 170 degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit. The component reached 250 degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit within five minutes, indicating that problems could development in real-world operational environments. Soon after, members of the VRC requested insight into the production processes behind the development of the BTSI housing and pin components. FCA engineers looked into the matter and found that the fabrication process had remained consistent prior to and following Dec. 31, 2016.</p>\n<p>The VRC continued to investigate the matter throughout January 2018, opening a nationwide field review and repair order search. The latter effort yielded three reports that referenced vehicles that suffered BTSI failure and were produced after Dec. 31, 2016. Owners reported being able to shift out of park without pressing the brake pedal or turning the ignition. On Jan. 26, 2018, the VRC found two additional field reports outlining the same issue.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 1, 2018, the VRC decided that a voluntary safety recall was required.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA is currently working on a mechanical remedy, which it will offer free of charge through an owner reimbursement program.

The inquiry revealed that the brake switch had been used across multiple models but that it did not pose a serious issue for some due to production quirks or the presence of brake system redundancies. On Dec. 8, 2017, engineering personnel conducted an internal test evaluate the impact of the defective brake switch and determined that drivers with manual vehicles could shift out of park without depressing the brake pedal. A similar test involving a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission was conducted Dec. 19, 2017, and yielded identical results.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 1, 2018, the FCA&nbsp;Vehicle Regulations Committee reviewed the matter opted to launch a voluntary safety recall. As of Jan. 26, 2018, FCA has received two customer assistance inquiry records and five field reports related to the defective brake pedal switches.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA intends to direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V098-7606.pdf\">replace the brake pedal switches</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document. The company will notify both dealers and owners March 30, 2018. Owners in need of more immediate assistance can contact FCA customer service at (800)&nbsp;853-1403. They should use the internal recall reference code U09 when calling. Owners can also reach out to the NHTSA directly using its Vehicle Safety Hotline at (888) 327-4236.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=4222","createdAt":"2018-02-16T11:19:52.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-02-17T01:04:52.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T06:07:42.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T19:52:42.000Z","display_date":"February 16, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2018,"month":2,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2017-Jeep-Wrangler-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"2017-Jeep-Wrangler","category":{"id":20,"name":"Chrysler","slug":"chrysler-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrysler_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Chrysler","slug":"chrysler-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrysler_RM.png"},{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"},{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"}]},{"id":13635,"title":"Nissan recalls vehicles with defective brakes","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/nissan-recalls-vehicles-defective-brakes/","status":"publish","slug":"nissan-recalls-vehicles-defective-brakes","excerpt":"<p>Nissan North America has recalled more than 400 vehicles potentially equipped with defective brake components.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Franklin, Tenn. &#8211; Feb. 14, 2018 &#8211; Nissan North America has recalled more than 400 vehicles potentially equipped with <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCLRPT-18V086-8955.PDF\">defective brake components</a>, according to documentation submitted to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>The campaign affects 2015-2017 Nissan Juke Nismo RS hatchbacks produced between July 6, 2015, and Jan. 30, 2017.

Such an event could lead to complete drive belt detachment, resulting in the immediate termination of engine and power steering operations, and increasing the likelihood of an accident. As a result, the defective part poses a serious threat to occupants. However, Mitsubishi has not received reports connecting the any accidents or injuries to the defect.</p>\n<p>Drivers with vehicles on the verge of shutting down due to drive belt automatic tensioner fracturing will see the battery charge warning light illuminate.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Mitsubishi received a field report in September 2010 describing an instance of automatic tensioner breakage. This prompted the company to launch an investigation into the issue to ascertain a root cause. In December 2011, engineers for the automaker found that production staff had swapped the bearing in the automatic tensioner for a lead-free alternative in March 2008 and suspected that the new product was cracking when operating in high-load environments. Mitsubishi reshaped the bearing to reduce surface stress and initiated a field monitoring campaign with an expiration date of November 2015.</p>\n<p>In December 2015, the car manufacturer reviewed the results of the four-year field monitoring program and began another program scheduled to conclude in January 2018.</p>\n<p>Last month, Mitsubishi conducted another data review and found the occurrence of automatic tensioner breakage was higher than expected and increasing. The company called for a voluntary safety recall Jan. 19 to address the problem.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Mitsubishi intends to direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V069-3370.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replace the drive belt tensioners</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgment document.

In January 2018, the car company&#8217;s Recall Committee convened to assess the issue. The group ultimately decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<p>Aston Martin notified dealers Jan. 29.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The automaker has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V065-5345.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">install contact bridges and springs</a> in affected models free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgment document. These components should facilitate proper grounding and prevent instances of unintentional air bag deployment. Aston Martin intends to contact owners via first-class mail March 1 through March 11. Owners in need of more immediate help can contact Aston Martin customer service at (888) 923-9988. They can also reach out the NHTSA directly using its Vehicle Safety Hotline at (888) 327-4236.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=13457","createdAt":"2018-02-07T04:36:43.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-02-07T18:21:43.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-13T06:40:04.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-04-13T20:25:04.000Z","display_date":"February 07, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":32,"name":"Ken Boyd","slug":"ken"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"18V-065","recall_date":"January 18, 2019"},"year":2018,"month":2,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Green-Aston-Martin-DB11-768x509.jpg","alt_text":"Green Aston Martin DB11 on race track recall","cld_public_id":"Green-Aston-Martin-DB11","category":{"id":35,"name":"Aston Martin","slug":"aston-martin-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/astonmartin_ms.png"},"tags":[{"id":1837,"name":"2017-2018 Aston Martin DB11recall","slug":"2017-2018-aston-martin-db11recall"},{"id":1839,"name":"Aston Martin airbag defect","slug":"aston-martin-airbag-defect"}],"categories":[{"id":35,"name":"Aston Martin","slug":"aston-martin-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/astonmartin_ms.png"}]},{"id":4236,"title":"FCA recalls Jeeps with defective fuel lines","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/fca-recalls-jeeps-with-defective-fuel-lines/","status":"publish","slug":"fca-recalls-jeeps-with-defective-fuel-lines","excerpt":"<p>Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has recalled more than 1,200 sport utility vehicles potentially equipped with defective fuel lines.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auburn Hills, Mich. &#8211; Feb. 5, 2017 &#8211; Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has recalled more than 1,200 sport utility vehicles potentially equipped with <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCLRPT-18V048-1406.PDF\">defective fuel lines</a>, according to documentation submitted to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.
