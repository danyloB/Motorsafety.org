Sometimes, hard acceleration overheats and damages a part called the inverter, which controls power flow in the car.&nbsp; This usually triggers a fail-safe mode &#8211; also known as a&nbsp; “limp-home” mode &#8211;&nbsp; but this specific defect is causing cars to stall instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudden loss of power on the road can cause collisions, which may lead to injury and even death of the driver and other motorists.&nbsp; The recall officially begins on August 10, 2020, but repairs will become available <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCMN-20V369-4210.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">sometime in July</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, drivers “<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCMN-20V369-4210.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">should avoid placing a high load on the hybrid system by avoiding [rapidly accelerating from a full stop] when possible.</a>”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Driving risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stalling at a stoplight is arguably not as dangerous as losing power on the freeway. Vehicles may not be able to react in time and could ram a stalled car from behind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2019, Ralph Vartabedian of the LA Times <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-fi-prius-overheat-inverter-defect-20190414-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">reported</a> on drivers’ terrifying experiences with Prius inverter failure. “A Marina del Rey woman had to cross three lanes of fast-moving traffic on the 91 Freeway,” he wrote. “In another case, a Florida woman was rear-ended. The crash left her with a cracked vertebra and a punctured lung.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your car stalls, you should immediately turn on the emergency hazard lights and call 911 and your roadside assistance provider. Do not leave your vehicle if you are driving down a highway with several lanes of traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Another software update</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Toyota’s fix for the recall, like in 2018, is a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RMISC-20V369-2762.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">software update</a>. However, last time, dealers <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-fi-prius-overheat-inverter-defect-20190414-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">continued to see damaged inverters</a> in cars that had received an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Toyota’s largest Southern California dealers, Roger Hogan reported the original issue to Toyota in 2017 and sued the company over the defect. Hogan believes the software is not the real problem, and that the only genuine fix would be to replace the inverter with a newer model, costing $2,000 per unit, according to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-fi-prius-overheat-inverter-defect-20190414-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Vartabedian’s article</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toyota has launched a separate program to “repair or replace” damaged inverters for free before an update is performed. However, in order to qualify, the<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RMISC-20V369-2762.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\"> inverter must already be broken.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 266,000 cars are included in this Toyota recall.

This is a fire hazard and poses the risk that drivers could stall on the road and get hit. It also increases pollution produced by the  car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall affects only Mazda CX-30s that were assembled at a specific factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While no accidents have occurred as a result of this recall, one Mazda dealer <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V347-8603.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">reported</a> that a car’s fuel was leaking out of the emissions system after the tank had been refilled. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V347-8603.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Another stalled</a> as it was being delivered to a customer. The cause was the same: the fuel evaporative vent hose was not connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vent hose is part of the Evaporative Emission Control System (EVAP) that is used to stop fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere.&nbsp; A malfunction within this system means that the vapors can pollute the environment all the time even if the vehicle is idle.&nbsp; Additionally, fuel leaks can increase the risk of fire and engine stall, both of which can injure the driver and other motorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Car owners should be notified by August 11 to take the vehicles to check if the hose is disconnected. The repairs will be covered under the new vehicle warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separately, Mazda CX-30 SUVs and Mazda3 compacts <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/2020-mazda-cx-30-mazda3-recall-front-brake-caliper-bolts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">are being recalled</a> to check and “tighten the bolts on the front brakes” to reduce the risk of crash.

The plant conducted an investigation and found that a worker did not finish connecting the hoses on the vehicles they worked on. It is unclear whether this one worker is responsible for the defect in all 12,097 vehicles. But all workers received additional training as a result of the failure. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Vehicle fires</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. Fire Administration <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fius20th.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">2019 Report on Fire in the United States</a> stated that equipment failures accounted for at least 20% of vehicle fires between 2009 and 2017. The number could be higher — in 24% of vehicle fires, the precise cause could not be determined (partly because many fires occur after a collision, and partly because fire has a handy way of destroying the evidence.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuel is extremely flammable, which is why cars are built to keep it contained. Any situation where it is leaking poses a hazard to drivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/Public-Education/Resources/Safety-tip-sheets/Car_Fire_Safety.ashx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">According to the National Fire Protection Association</a>, if a vehicle catches fire, the driver should:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pull over as quickly as it is safe to do so, to a safe location off the road such as the breakdown lane or rest stop.</p><p>Once stopped, TURN OFF the engine.</p><p>GET everyone out of the car.

The former leads to stalls, while the latter means that a parked vehicle will not stay put on a slope (unless its parking brake is engaged) posing a rollaway risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newer Cherokees, which have stronger “teeth” on their PTU gears, are not part of the recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The risks</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_214787653.jpg\" alt=\"Anton Yelchin attends the 'Cymbeline' Photocall during the 71st Venice Film Festival on September 3, 2014 in Venice, Italy.\" class=\"wp-image-18041\" width=\"343\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_214787653.jpg 5760w, https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_214787653-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_214787653-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_214787653-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_214787653-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" /><figcaption>Actor Anton Yelchin was killed in &#8220;freak accident&#8221; on June 18th, 2016 when his Jeep Grand Cherokee rolled back and pinned him against a brick wall.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, there has been only <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V343-9959.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">one accident</a> related to this recall.&nbsp; But, stalling while driving can be dangerous and cause collisions, as faster-moving vehicles may hit the car from behind.

If your fuel pump fails, you will not be able to restart the car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safest thing to do is turn on your flashers and try to get out of the road. If traffic conditions do not permit you to do this, stay in your lane &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to block two lanes at once.

Additionally, 171 of these 2018-2019 Toyota RAV4 models have been categorized as unreachable and 13 have been removed from the recall. Two groups of these RAV4 vehicles were remedied in 2020 and Three others were remedied in 2021 due to these Lower Suspension Problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laguna Hills, CA – Jun 03, 2020</em> –<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V286000&amp;refurl=rss\">Toyota recalls</a> 2018-2019 RAV4 and RAV4 Hybrid vehicles because of cracks in the lower suspension arms. The cracks could result in the separation of the suspension arm from the front wheel assembly, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hazards Created by the Faulty Suspension</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a crack in the suspension arm, it could eventually cause the suspension arm to break from the front wheel assembly. Depending upon the depth of the crack on the front lower arm and the vehicle’s driving patterns, the driver could potentially lose control of the vehicle when driving at high speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crashes that occur when drivers are traveling at high speeds are more serious and usually result in more severe injuries if not death. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), speeding was a factor in<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding\"> 9378 traffic-related deaths</a> in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon discovering the problem with the cracks developing in some of the steel slabs, Toyota decided to conduct a voluntary recall of the vehicles for safety. Toyota’s records reveal that as of May 14, 2020, there are no known reported incidents related to the faulty RAV4 suspension issue, and no warranty claims have been filed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Number of Vehicles Affected</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because only vehicles assembled with a specific slab of steel material from a specific supplier under certain production conditions contain the defect, Toyota does not know the actual number of the defected vehicles that exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, the 2020 Toyota recalls are based on the production records of the vehicles that could potentially be affected, which is a little more than 9,500 vehicles. The manufacture dates for the RAV4 vehicles are between September 25, 2019, and October 25, 2019. For the 2020 Toyota recalls, at least 1,000 of those RAV4 vehicles were distributed to Puerto Rico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toyota made a point to note that the RAV4 recalls do not apply to other Toyota or Lexus vehicles sold in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Toyota RAV4 Safety Issues</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, the 2019 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid sport utility vehicles were included in a recall for potentially defective brakes. More recently, owners should be reminded of the 2020 Toyota recalls relating to the fuel-tank issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toyota is not the only manufacturer that seems to have problems with their suspension assemblies. Similar to the issue with the Toyota RAV4,<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagen-recalls-suvs-with-defective-suspension-assemblies/\"> Volkswagen recalled</a> more that 7000 SUVs with defective suspension assemblies in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Toyota Not Yet Ready to Repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a remedy is not yet available, Toyota estimates that RAV4 vehicle owners will be able to take their vehicle to any certified Toyota dealership to have the front lower suspension arms replaced as early as July 2020.
