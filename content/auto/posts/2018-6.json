The campaign affects multiple models across the Land Rover brand, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2017 Land Rover Range Rover sport utility vehicles produced between Oct. 25, 2016, and Jan. 17, 2017.</li>\n<li>2017 Land Rover Range Rover Sport SUVs produced between Aug. 30, 2016, and Jan. 20, 2017.</li>\n<li>2017 Land Rover Discovery SUVs produced between Sept. 28, 2016, and Jan. 10, 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jaguar suspects all of the vehicles referenced in the action contain the defective parts.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>Affected models contain fuel gauges that incorrectly indicate low fuel levels. In the event that the defective features misinterpret gasoline levels, sudden engine shut off may occur as the vehicles in question are designed to cease operation when the available fuel range drops below 17 miles. Such an event may increase the likelihood of an accident.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Jaguar Land Rover believes the defect poses a serious safety hazard to occupants. However, the British automaker has yet to receive reports connecting the problematic fuel gauges to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<p>Owners&nbsp;of recalled vehicles will see low fuel warning lights prior to engine shut off. In some cases, owners may be able to restart their vehicles and regain motive power following such an event. However, engineers have found that the vehicles never fully regain full operability.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>In April 2018, the Jaguar Land Rover Product Safety and Compliance Committee received several electronic product quality reports from dealers in the U.S. market outlining instances in which multiple Land Rover models seemed to display incorrect fuel level readings. The group reviewed these reports April 10, 2018, and decided to initiate an official investigation. Throughout April and May 2018, Jaguar engineering personnel tested 2017 Land Rover Range Rover and Discovery models and successfully replicated the issue. Technical specialists also found that the defective fuel gauges initiated engine shut off.</p>\n<p>Following this initial inquiry, Jaguar embarked on a more exhaustive root cause investigation. This evaluation revealed that the body control modules installed in the affected vehicles were transmitting incorrect fuel levels to fuel gauges due to misconfigured microcontrollers, which were communicating incorrect fuel levels during their transitions from initialization to sleep-wake mode. The PSCC evaluated these findings May 8, 2018, and moved the issue on to the Jaguar Land Rover Recall Determination Committee.</p>\n<p>The RDC reviewed the situation May 17, 2018, and determined that a recall was necessary due to the safety hazard posed by engine condition that accompanies the defect. The automaker informed dealers of the forthcoming recall campaign June 7, 2018.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V337-7711.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">install new software</a> in the affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document. The car manufacturers intends to reach out to owners via first-class mail on or around July 16, 2018.

Under normal circumstances, the pull-capable feature enables Pacifica owners to shift from &#8220;park&#8221; into &#8220;neutral&#8221; mode if the rotary shift knob malfunctions or if the vehicle won&#8217;t start. The easiest way to do this is through the use of a common screwdriver.</p>\n<p>However, according to the Michigan-based automaker, the manual park release plug in affected vehicles may not require a screwdriver or similar device to manipulate the plug because some were installed improperly during the manufacturing process. As a result, the component can be engaged mistakenly, causing the vehicle to roll away, potentially resulting in the injury of a bystander or damage to property surrounding the minivan.</p>\n<p>Although the automaker can&#8217;t be sure which specific Pacificas may be impacted, Chrysler says it has been able to determine where they originated. The minivans were built at the Windsor Assembly Plant somewhere between mid June 2016 and early April of this year, the model years confined to 2017 and 2018. Chrysler says any Pacificas assembled after April 6 should be in the free and clear with respect to this component problem because the MPR plugs were redesigned with a &#8220;higher pull-out force, requiring the use of a screwdriver&#8221; or similar tool.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Chrysler became aware of the instrumentation failing on March 22 during routine performance testing, according to a chronology of events compiled by NHTSA. A few days later, upon closer examination of the issue, an internal investigator discovered the problem wasn&#8217;t unique to just one Pacifica, but potentially many more, when the plug could be adjusted too easily in several other vehicles examined. Additional testing conducted over the course of a month revealed that the nature and scope of the flaw necessitated a voluntary safety recall due to non-compliance.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Chrysler says the recall will go into effect officially on August 3, the date in which owners of the impacted Pacifica models will be notified of the plug problem by mailers sent to owners&#8217; home addresses. Motorists are urged to take their vehicles to their nearest Chrysler dealership so the MPR can be repaired or replaced. This fix will come at no charge to the owner.</p>\n<p>For further information regarding the recall, call Chrysler&#8217;s customer service department at 1-800-853-1403. The reference number is U50.

What at the time was believed to be an isolated incident proved otherwise, as by September, Volkswagen received numerous complaints from owners experiencing the same seat buckle issue. This spawned an investigation as to the source of the problem, which was determined through crash testing procedures and an internal review. The Volkswagen AG Product Safety Commission determined the defect and insufficient owner&#8217;s manual information warranted a recall as of May 30.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Motorists affected by the recall&nbsp;are urged to take their Atlas vehicles to their local Volkswagen dealership, cautioned the NHTSA recall document. Additionally, the German automaker says that no later than August 3, it will proceed with notifying all owners and dealers to inspect the second row center seat belt buckles for signs of a potential flaw and schedule a repair. Owners will not have to pay for the fix if they coordinate with their dealer. Alternatively, owners can get in touch with Volkswagen directly by dialing 1-800-5298 and use 69X1 as a reference code.</p>\n<p>Seat belts have proven to save thousands of lives in the millions of accidents that occur in the U.S. each year. In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, motorists&#8217; buckling up <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/seat-belts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">saved an estimated 14,668 lives</a>, according to NHTSA.

In the event of ASCI failure, front air bag and seat belt pretensioner deployment is inhibited, leaving both drivers and front passengers susceptible to injury. However, as of May 28, 2018, Kia has yet to receive field reports connecting the defective ACUs to any accidents or injuries.</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Timeline of Events</span></h2>\n<div>In March 2014, a customer filed suit against Kia, alleging that the frontal air bags installed in his 2012 Kia Forte sedan <a id=\"LPlnk84398\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RMISC-18V363-5570.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"LPlnk84398\">failed to deploy during an accident</span></a>, according to an internal chronology document given to the NHTSA. The automaker reported this event to the NHTSA, which then reached out to Kia for more information regarding the potential defect in July 2014.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Between March 2015 and June 2015, Kia conducted tests on the vehicle, including one trial during which an engineer attempted to download the ACU but was unable to communicate with the module. This prompted the car company to connect with its Michigan-based ACU supplier ZRF TWR. Personnel from the vendor replicated Kia&#8217;s actions and were unable to connect to the ACU. External engineering consultants looked into the matter and determined that ACU had compromised the front impact sensors, rendering the air bags in the vehicle useless. ZRF TWR then informed Kia that the NHTSA was investigating numerous models using its ACU units.</div>\n<div>Kia continued to investigate the matter throughout the remainder of 2015, 2016 and 2017. These analyses failed to reveal a root cause. However, owners continued to report air bag deployment issues, forcing the automaker to expand the group of potentially affected vehicles to include Optima and Koup sedans and Sedona minivans.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Between January and February 2018, the NHTSA reconnected with Kia on several occasions to discuss the defective ACUs and requested that it re-establish a partnership with ZRF TWR to finally resolve the issue. In March, Hyundai recalled a large population of vehicles suffering from ACU failure, an event that engineers had linked to ASCI degradation caused by electrical overstress. On March 14, 2018, Kia officials met with the NHTSA in Washington D.C. to discuss the ACU failures occurring in its vehicles in the context of the findings mentioned in the Hyundai recall disclosure. Following this meeting, the NHTSA requested that Kia open a new investigation to assess whether the ASCIs in its ACUs were susceptible electrical overstress.</div>\n<div>Throughout May 2018, Kia engineers conducted several tests, including a number of trials at the Vehicle Research and Test Center. On May 24, 2018, the automaker met with the NHTSA to review the data collected during one such test and found that vehicle involved showed signs of ASCI breakdown as a result of electrical overstress. This finding compelled Kia to issue a voluntary recall May 28, 2018.</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The Solution</span></h2>\n<div>Kia has <a id=\"LPlnk926865\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V363-4635.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"LPlnk926865\">not yet developed an effective remedy</span></a>, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document.
