- 6 hour deployment time
- Also if you look through the previous commits you should be able to find some
- features that were started in a new Branch but never completed like twilio integration and a directory of all recalls from nhtsa
- There was also an admin page that was created so we would be able to moderate the listings and change requests from dealers.


ISSUES
- invalid tag/category url freezes page
- slider heights aren't dynamic so it gets over page elements
- left sidebar needs to be fixed

QUESTIONS
- do we have any design guidelines to follow about how to build/organize/design the UI?

Organize templates and optimize api usages:
- dealers/*
- type/*

- optimize generator to only generate pages for single post, category, tag and authors
- create new pages only when new posts are added to json db
- create a stats file with details about last import to compare with new changes and generate accordingly
