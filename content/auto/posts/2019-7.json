Both conditions increase the risk of a crash or an injury.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Auburn Hills, MI – July 17, 2019</em> – Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) has recalled 27,822 vehicles whose may airbags may randomly go off&nbsp; or not go off when needed. The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2015 Volkswagen Tiguan compact SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2016 Volkswagen (VW) Tiguan compact SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2015 VW CC cars</strong></li><li><strong>2016 VW CC cars</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall concerns the airbag control module that is in charge of deploying the airbags. A defective capacitor – a device that sits in the module and powers the airbag – may deactivate the airbags or,&nbsp; in rare cases, cause them to go off unexpectedly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defect is caused by an error on the part of the supplier, ZF Group. Since 2018, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/volvo-recalls-luxury-sedans-for-takata-like-airbag-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the German auto parts manufacturer has been subject to at least 68 lawsuits</a>, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the airbags inflate without a warning, they can injure vehicle occupants and cause the driver to crash. If they fail to deploy in a crash, occupants are less protected from impact. In fact, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/808470\" target=\"_blank\">their risk of fatal injury is 11% higher than it would be if the airbags were working properly</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A turned on airbag warning light may indicate airbag failure. Drivers are advised to immediately take the car in for repair if the light comes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen dealers will update the car with software that will monitor the electrical activity in the airbag control module. If the software detects a problem within a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCRIT-19V535-4607.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10-year extended warranty period</a>, Volkswagen will replace the module for free. The update <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCMN-19V535-7548.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has been available since November 13, 2019</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Close to 10,000 vehicles still need to be fixed under this VW airbag recall.

As a consequence, the defect poses a serious safety hazard to owners and occupants. That said, the automaker has yet to receive reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Porsche&#8217;s airbag control module supplier, ZF Group, based in Germany, received a report from Kia Motors in August 2011 describing a situation in which the owner of a vehicle featuring the brand&#8217;s products was involved in a collision, during which his air&nbsp;bags <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RMISC-18E043-5831.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">failed to deploy</a>, according to NHTSA documents. ZF group investigated the incident and determined electrical overstress to be the cause of the incident. Less than one year later, another Kia owner, this one in Egypt, had a similar experience, which ZF Group again linked to EOS.</p>\n<p>The parts vendor received four additional reports throughout 2015 — three involving Kia vehicles and one involving a Hyundai Motor Company vehicle — which detailed instances of air&nbsp;bag malfunction. ZF Group links all incidents to EOS and in January 2016 contacts the NHTSA for assistance. The company collaborated with various automakers, parts providers and the NHTSA that year to study the problem in-depth. The work continued into 2017, during which time ZF Group issued multiple customer communications and received new reports of air&nbsp;bag deployment failure.</p>\n<p>Hyundai issued a voluntary safety recall for select vehicles outfitted with ZF Group airbag control modules in February 2018. Kia followed suit in June 2018, at which point the NHTSA advised ZF Group to launch an independent recall for its air&nbsp;bag control modules. The company filed the official Part 573 paperwork June 13, 2018. Porsche received a copy of this recall June 24, 2019 and on July 10, 2019, elected to initiate its own recall campaign.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The German automaker intends to direct dealers to assess the air&nbsp;bag control modules in affected vehicles and replace them if necessary, free of charge. Porsche will notify dealers Sept. 15, 2019 and <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V533-4490.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contact owners</a> via first-class mail within 60 days of that date, per NHTSA documentation. Owners in need of more immediate assistance can contact Porsche customer service personnel by calling (800) 767-7243. Callers should use the recall identification code AKB4.

The problem is believed to be linked to misalignment, in which the headlights were misadjusted beyond the maximum height permitted under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108. The vehicles subject to the recall are 2019 models.</p>\n<p>Affected owners are urged to remove their automobiles from the road and return them to an authorized Maserati dealer so the proper fix can be implemented free of charge.

The specific nature of the problem concerns the adaptive front lighting system, the headlights of which may have been misadjusted at some point during assembly.</p>\n<p>Per FMVSS No. 108, or &#8220;Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment,&#8221; the cutoff angle for headlights can be no higher than 0.4 degrees down from the H-H line. The 420-plus Levatis under recall notices all have headlights that are positioned higher than the maximum gradient allowed under FMVSS. This presents a safety issue for motorists approaching the affected vehicles that increases the risk of a collision due to possibly blinding the oncoming driver.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>This issue <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V521-1859.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first came to light</a> on May 10, 2019, when personnel for the luxury automaker began testing of the Levantes&#8217; vertical headlamps. At least 40 of the vehicles with adaptive front lighting system technology were misaligned. Those suspicions were confirmed in follow-up testing, which began approximately a month later on June 11. By July 3, Maserati decided a voluntary safety recall of the model was the best path forward and got in touch with federal officials about their concern July 11. The NHTSA acknowledged Maserati&#8217;s notification approximately two weeks later.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Starting Aug. 26, Maserati will notify those impacted by this recall. Operators are advised to take their cars to a nearby dealership so their headlights can be corrected. Per usual, the repair will come at no expense.</p>\n<p>For more information on this and other automotive recalls, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17541","createdAt":"2019-07-29T08:44:23.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-07-29T22:29:23.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T00:26:47.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T14:11:47.000Z","display_date":"July 29, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V-521","recall_date":"July 11, 2019"},"year":2019,"month":7,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1689560176-768x513.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1689560176","category":{"id":13,"name":"Maserati","slug":"maserati","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maserati_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1408,"name":"2019 Maserati Levanti recall","slug":"2019-maserati-levanti-recall"},{"id":1409,"name":"Maserati headlamp recall","slug":"maserati-headlamp-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":13,"name":"Maserati","slug":"maserati","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maserati_RM.png"}]},{"id":17535,"title":"Chrysler recalls trucks with defective fuel lines","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalls-trucks-with-defective-fuel-lines/","status":"publish","slug":"chrysler-recalls-trucks-with-defective-fuel-lines","excerpt":"<p>Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has recalled almost 500 diesel vehicles potentially equipped with defective fuel line assemblies.</p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hill, Calif. — July 26, 2019 — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has recalled almost 500 vehicles potentially equipped with <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V498-5736.PDF\">defective fuel line assemblies</a>, according to documentation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The campaign affects 2019 Dodge RAM 2500 diesel pickup trucks produced between May 9, 2019, and May 18, 2019; 2019 Dodge RAM 3500 diesel pickup trucks and cab chassis produced between May 7-18, 2019 and 2019 Dodge RAM 4500 and 5500 diesel cab chassis. The American automaker suspects just 10% of the recalled vehicles contain the defective components.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>The affected vehicles could contain fuel lines with incorrectly configured end fittings that are prone to leakage. These problematic parts drastically increase the risk of engine fire and therefore pose a serious risk to owners, occupants and pedestrians. However, FCA has yet to receive reports of any accidents or injuries connected to the defective fuel lines.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>The FCA Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance group launched an investigation May 21, 2019, after personnel from the FCA quality department alerted it to leaking fuel line assemblies found at a Cummins diesel engine production plant. The VSRC then initiated several internal actions, including multiple packaging studies and an exhaustive review of Cummins&#8217; records to grasp the approximate number of potential ignition sources present within associated vehicle engine compartments.</p>\n<p>That organization also spearheaded customer-consequence studies, remedy tests, root-cause investigations and vehicle-scope analyses. These inquiries, all of which unfolded throughout May 2019, revealed that the leaking fuel lines could drip gasoline directly onto multiple combustible engine parts and cause fires. And the root-cause investigation showed that the leakage could be traced to incorrectly formed fuel line end fittings. Cummins confirmed these findings through dyno tests conducted during the week of May 27, 2019.</p>\n<p>The VSRC confirmed the suspected field population in early June 2019 by assessing all vehicles on quality hold, along with those already in the field. The FCA Vehicle Regulations Committee then reviewed the VSRC&#8217;s final findings June 20, 2019, and decided to conduct a voluntary recall.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>FCA has directed dealers test and, if necessary, replace the fuel lines in recalled vehicles, free of charge.

The campaign affects 2019 Subaru Ascent SUVs produced between June 8, 2019, and June 11, 2019. The Japanese automaker suspects that all of the vehicles involved in the recall contain these defective components.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>The affected vehicles could come equipped with driveshafts whose support bracing surfaces and bolts have been inadvertently painted and are therefore disconnection. Continuous vibration could shake these essential fixtures lose, leading to driveshaft separation and sudden loss of motive power. The defective parts pose a serious hazard to owners and occupants as a consequence. That said, Subaru has yet to receive any reports linking the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>On June 12, 2019, quality assurance personnel inspecting recently assembled vehicles at the Subaru of America production plant in Lafayette, Indiana encountered a 2019 Subaru Ascent with an out-of-specification driveshaft torque brace bolt. The automaker connected with its driveshaft supplier, Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas, based in Monroe, Georgia, and requested that it conduct an internal investigation to understand error. The supplier executed a review June 13, 2019, and found that some production teams were not masking driveshaft support mounting surfaces during the painting process. Subaru and Hitachi then used assembly records to assess the extent of the issue between June 14, 2019, and July 1, 2019.</p>\n<p>The automaker reviewed all investigation findings and approved a voluntary recall July 2, 2019.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Subaru has directed dealers to inspect the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V519-4401.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalled vehicles</a> and replace any defective driveshaft components, free of charge, per NHTSA documents.

Given this is one of several recalls affecting the company&#8217;s popular hybrid over the past five years, Toyota urges Prius C owners to get in touch with their local dealer so this issue can be corrected if this&nbsp;or another flaw exists. Toyota hasn&#8217;t yet officially informed registered owners of this potential hazard, but will make them aware via first-class mail&nbsp;Aug.&nbsp;12. Safety-related automotive recalls are free of charge, and this one is no exception.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>As documented by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Toyota is <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V491-2992.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalling approximately 464</a> 2018-2019 Prius C vehicles. The problem affecting a limited number of these hybrid automobiles is related to its propulsion system. Apparently, the auxiliary battery, which comes standard in all Priuses, may not receive the power it needs to propel the vehicle forward because of a flaw within the circuit board, which may have occurred at some point during the manufacturing or assembly process. If the transistor to the circuit board were to separate, the battery may lose its ability to energize the vehicle. This of course presents a safety hazard for Prius C owners as well as others on the road should this malfunction occur, especially when moving at a high rate of speed.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Unlike other recalls cleared with the NHTSA, which tend to be more isolated in nature, this isn&#8217;t the first affecting the Prius. As reported by the Los Angeles Times and other media outlets, an estimated 20,000 Prius owners <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyota-announces-3rd-prius-recall-131901852.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">have reported power system failures</a> tracing back to 2014. At that time, over 800,000 Priuses were pulled from the market because of a glitch with the vehicle&#8217;s inverter transistors, which also impacted propulsion and the potential for the automobile to suddenly power down. This recall affected C models manufactured between 2010 and 2014. Another recall was ordered last October to correct certain&nbsp;power failures that the original recall didn&#8217;t address.</p>\n<p>This most recent recall is different in a couple of respects. First, it pertains to 2018 and 2019 models and it&#8217;s much smaller. Indeed, Toyota believes that of the 464 vehicles included in the recall, likely only 10% have the defect. This is partially due to the DC-DC converter that is exclusive to those Prius C vehicles built between February 2018 and October of the same year.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Even though there may be no immediate signs of separation, the propulsion issue may develop over time, depending on how frequently Prius owners drive and how many years they go before buying a new or used vehicle. Given this, Toyota is making this move out of an abundance of caution. The company says it will formally inform owners of the safety concern by mail starting in mid-August and will encourage drivers to take their automobile back to the dealer from which they purchased it or to any authorized Toyota dealership. If it&#8217;s deemed appropriate, the DC-DC converter will be replaced with an alternative unit, which will come at no cost to the owner for parts or labor.</p>\n<p>As previously referenced, this latest is recall is one of several for Prius models.

The issue appears to have originated during the assembly process. Given that buckling up is a primary law in most states and the inherent safety risks associated with not using a seat belt, Ford is coordinating with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that these vehicles are fixed.</p>\n<p>Owners can expect to receive an official notification pertaining to this recall starting July 29. Motorists are urged to take their trucks back to the dealer so the problem can be assessed and ameliorated.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to NHTSA and Ford, approximately <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V518-6406.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7,579 2019 Ford Rangers</a> &#8211; one of the more popular passenger trucks in the world &#8211; may contain seat belts containing flaws that render the restraint system inoperable. The issue concerns the assembly&#8217;s poke yoke fixture, which was not installed correctly in the front passenger-side unit, as opposed to the driver&#8217;s side. The component manufacturer is based in Mexico, but it&#8217;s unclear if the problem originated there with the parts itself or during the actual assembly.</p>\n<p>If passengers can&#8217;t buckle or the latch fails at some point while traveling, a crash dramatically increases the risk of injury or death. Ford believes that this issue is confined to only those 2019 Ranger models with the SuperCab body style. There&#8217;s a good chance that the belts are fine, as safety officials believe 1% of the total recalled include the defect. Nevertheless, Ford is making the move out of an abundance of caution.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In late June, the Critical Concern Review Group at Ford was <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V518-7818.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alerted to a warranty claim</a> made by a Ranger SuperCab owner, who noted that the passenger side belt buckle wasn&#8217;t latching. The quality control team followed up on this alert and discovered that the glitch may be related to the unit&#8217;s anchor and the routing method used.&nbsp; A more thorough inspection determined that it was an installation problem affecting the poke yoke, which is a&nbsp;seat belt unit fixture. CCRG followed up with the supplier and concluded that all poke yokes installed prior to June 19 may be vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Thanks in part to traffic safety campaigns like &#8220;Click It or Ticket,&#8221; seat belts are worn by the vast majority of Americans today. Motorists are required to use them in 49 of 50 states and in those that have primary laws on the books &#8211; totaling 20 in addition to the District of Columbia &#8211; motorists can be pulled over and fined if they&#8217;re not buckled.</p>\n<p>Tragically, thousands have died in recent years due to not wearing a seat belt. Based on the most recent statistics available from NHTSA, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/buckle-it-could-save-your-life\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10,428 passengers in the U.S.</a> were killed in 2016 from injuries they sustained in crashes.</p>\n<p>Neither Ford nor NHTSA is aware of any accidents stemming from this recall, with none reported as of July 10.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford knows how to fix this issue and seeks to inform 2019 SuperCab owners starting July 29, via first-class mail. Dealers have already been notified. Motorists can take their vehicle to any Ford dealer, where upon examination, the right front seatbelt assembly will be swapped out for one that works. This repair will come at no charge. All parties are expected to be notified no later than August 3.</p>\n<p>For more information on this recall and to see if you or someone you know is affected, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.

Should such a scenario occur, a fire could occur, thus posing a safety hazard for the driver and anyone in proximity to the blaze. The automaker says that while the chances for this to happen are remote, but is encouraging 2019 Ram owners to err on the side of caution and return the truck to the dealer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The recall is expected to get underway officially Aug.&nbsp;16 and drivers can expect to be notified by mail.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>As chronicled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Chrysler <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V498-3458.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is recalling 498</a> of the following Ram vehicles, all of which are 2019 models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ram 2500</li>\n<li>Ram 3500</li>\n<li>Ram 4500</li>\n<li>Ram 5500</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it&#8217;s not clear if all of these vehicles have been purchased or remain on dealers&#8217; lots, the recall concerns the trucks&#8217; diesel engines and the potential that some of them may leak fuel due to incorrectly formed end fittings. The placement of this flaw is such that the liquid could leach onto the engine, potentially causing a fire. Of the 498 vehicles&nbsp;that may be affected, the truck models most likely to contain the flaw are the&nbsp;Ram 2500 and Ram 3500. These vehicles were likely built between May 7 and 20, though&nbsp;precise dates&nbsp;could only be determined by knowing the trucks&#8217;&nbsp;body and cab types.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>The genesis of recalls often derive from current vehicle owners, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V498-5736.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">but in this instance</a>, Chrysler noticed the issue after learning that the supplier of the Rams&#8217; diesel engines had other engines leaking fuel. That happened May 21. Later on that month, Chrysler worked in concert with the supplier to see what, if anything, could occur if motorists&#8217; fuel lines were compromised, aside from the loss of fuel, a problem in and of itself. The assessment determined that a worst-case scenario was a fire, given that the leaks were occurring at connection points in the lines.</p>\n<p>Surveys were conducted June 3 to see which Ram vehicles were potentially vulnerable. The investigation ultimately determined that the parts themselves weren&#8217;t necessarily compromised but rather that the trucks were assembled around the same time as when the leaking fuel lines at the diesel engine supplier&#8217;s plant were originally reported.</p>\n<p>Vehicle fires are surprisingly common. According to the <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/v19i2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most recent statistics</a> available from the U.S. Fire Administration, approximately 171,500 automotive-related fires occurred on U.S. highways each year between 2014 and 2016. These resulted in $1.1 billion in property losses, 1,300 injuries and 345 fatalities. Approximately 45% of these blazes stem from mechanical failure and 62% derive from the engine. Crashes themselves are also a common cause of deadly vehicle fires.</p>\n<p>No accidents, injuries or fatalities are linked to the recall in question as of June 20, according to NHTSA documents.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Chrysler says that it plans to brief Ram owners of this problem that could affect their safety by first-class mail starting on August 16. Recipients are strongly encouraged to have their truck examined by their local dealer. The potentially vulnerable fuel lines have codes inscribed on them, which refer to the manufacturing date. Those that align with the suspect time period will be replaced free of charge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on this recall, please visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17192","createdAt":"2019-07-24T05:39:55.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-07-24T19:24:55.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T05:30:37.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T19:15:37.000Z","display_date":"July 24, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2019,"month":7,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1724716990-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1724716990","category":{"id":9,"name":"RAM","slug":"ram-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RAM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":9,"name":"RAM","slug":"ram-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RAM.png"}]},{"id":17186,"title":"Ford recalls vehicles with defective engine software","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-vehicles-with-defective-engine-software/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-recalls-vehicles-with-defective-engine-software","excerpt":"<p>Ford Motor Company has recalled almost 57,500 vehicles potentially equipped with defective engine software.</p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, Calif.&nbsp;— July 23, 2019 — Ford Motor Company has recalled almost 57,500 vehicles potentially equipped with <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V515-6667.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">defective engine software</a>, according to documentation submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The action affects 2012 Ford Focus sedans produced between Oct. 7, 2010, and July 23, 2012; 2013-2104 Ford Focus ST sedans produced between May 3, 2012, and Dec. 11, 2014; and 2017 Ford Focus sedans produced between Aug. 24, 2016, and April 13, 2017. Ford suspects that all of the vehicles involved in the recall contain the defective software.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The cars involved in the campaign could come equipped with powertrain control modules that lack updated software designed to detect malfunctioning canister purge valves. These components, when damaged, cause fuel vapors to expand and deform the surrounding fuel tank. This can, in turn, decrease drivability, and&nbsp;in some instances&nbsp;lead to loss of motive power. The defective PCMs potentially installed in the recalled vehicles therefore pose a safety hazard to&nbsp;operators&nbsp;and occupants. However, Ford has yet to receive reports of any accidents or injuries connected to the defect.</p>\n<p>The automaker advised all affected owners to keep their fuel tanks half full to prevent deformities related to fuel vapor expansion.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In November 2017, dealership personnel assessing a Ford Focus with a two-liter, direct-injection engine with Ford Racing software calibrations noticed some regularities. They then contacted Ford. The automaker deployed technicians to review the calibrations, which had been installed during a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCMN-18V735-0635.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">previous recall</a> involving stuck CPV valves, per Ford. The technicians found that the vehicle in question had PCM components that were not properly updated during the servicing process for this initial campaign.</p>\n<p>Ford later discovered that multiple models featured similarly problematic PCMs. With this insight in hand, the Ford Field Review Committee decided to greenlight a recall June 28, 2019.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford has directed dealers to inspect and, if necessary, recalibrate the PCMs in recalled vehicles, free of charge.

Should motorists go by the poundage listed, the overexertion may lead to a mechanical or handling issue that could lead to a crash. Motorists should check the label on their factory-installed floor mats to see if they&#8217;re affected and contact their nearest Toyota dealership so the clerical issue can be corrected. The replacement will come at no charge.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V503-5510.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documents filed</a> with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Southeast Toyota Distributors is recalling a combined 1,325 models. While the models themselves differ from one another they all contain the same flaw: a labeling error that misidentifies how much weight the cars can withstand. Load capacity is a detail that automakers must abide by, pursuant to the regulation &#8220;Tire Selection and Rims,&#8221; of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard.</p>\n<p>The following vehicles may contain errant load capacity information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2017-2019 Camry</li>\n<li>2017-2019 Corolla</li>\n<li>2017-2019 Sienna</li>\n<li>2017-2019 Yaris</li>\n<li>2017-2019 RAV4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V503-6724.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">detailed</a> in the Part 573 Safety Recall Report, whenever weight modifications are made to an automobile between certification and when they first go on showroom floors, they must be accounted for and corroborated through labeling if the weight differentiation is 100 pounds or more. However, some of the labels affixed to the factory floor mats were &#8220;not accurate to within 1% of the actual added weight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the worst case, a driver may overload a vehicle, which may increase the risk of a crash,&#8221; the report said.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>As is frequently the case, this issue was first noticed during a routine quality control check, this time conducted by Southeast Toyota Distributors. In March, a staff member determined that the load capacity modification specifics were included in only a portion of the automobiles that had received the weight changes. SET informed corporate and on June 20, the automaker determined that the appropriate corrections should proceed in accordance with the FMVSS standard No. 110. Dealers were notified of the impending recall roughly a week later.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Starting no later than August 27, SET says it will brief Toyota owners that their vehicle may be affected and will encourage them to bring the car to a local dealership. The proper label will be affixed to the floor mat, so it corresponds with the actual net weight. This will come at no expense to the owner.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or any other safety recall, please visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org.</a> Be sure to have your 17-digit VIN available.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17185","createdAt":"2019-07-22T10:41:53.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-07-23T00:26:53.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-20T03:09:10.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-20T16:54:10.000Z","display_date":"July 22, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V503000","recall_date":"June 28, 2019"},"year":2019,"month":7,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1059216626-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1059216626","category":{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"},"tags":[{"id":1420,"name":"2017-2019 Toyota Camry recall","slug":"2017-2019-toyota-camry-recall"},{"id":1421,"name":"2017-2019 Toyota Corolla recall","slug":"2017-2019-toyota-corolla-recall"},{"id":1424,"name":"2017-2019 Toyota RAV4 recall","slug":"2017-2019-toyota-rav4-recall"},{"id":1422,"name":"2017-2019 Toyota Sienna recall","slug":"2017-2019-toyota-sienna-recall"},{"id":1423,"name":"2017-2019 Toyota Yaris recall","slug":"2017-2019-toyota-yaris-recall"},{"id":1425,"name":"Toyota labeling issue","slug":"toyota-labeling-issue"},{"id":1426,"name":"Toyota load carrying compacity label","slug":"toyota-load-carrying-compacity-label"}],"categories":[{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"}]},{"id":17081,"title":"Luxury Automaker Issues Limited Recall Due to Air Bag Snag","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/luxury-automaker-issues-limited-recall-due-to-air-bag-snag/","status":"publish","slug":"luxury-automaker-issues-limited-recall-due-to-air-bag-snag","excerpt":"<p>Maserati North America is recalling a limited number of Granturismo vehicles due to the potential for the onboard air bag systems to malfunction. </p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; July 17, 2019 &#8211; Maserati North America is recalling a limited number of Granturismo vehicles due to the potential for the onboard air bag systems to malfunction and/or deactivate should motorists experience a traffic accident. It&#8217;s also possible the air bag may deploy when it&#8217;s not intended to, thus increasing the risk of a crash and potential for injury. Pursuant to federal law, operators and dealers affected by this safety recall will be informed by first-class mail so they can make the appropriate arrangements to have this issue examined and repaired if necessary. This fix will come at no charge to the owners.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V461-8357.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to paperwork filed</a> with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Maserati is recalling an estimated 739 Granturismo and Granturismo convertibles &#8211; whose model years range between 2015 and 2018 &#8211; because the electrical control units that power the air bags may be defective. Typically, these units have built in sensors that automatically trigger when placed under stress, causing the air bag to deploy when the vehicle is struck. However, the silver adhesive cathode involved in this process may have been corrupted at some point during manufacturing. This defect may also cause the air bag to uncoil without warning.</p>\n<p>The production dates for the models in question were between Sept. 2015 and June 2018 among Granturismo convertibles and Oct 2014 to February 2018 for hard-top Granturismo vehicles. The lion&#8217;s share of the recalled models &#8211; 545 of the 739 &#8211; are the former.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>In May 2019, Maserati&#8217;s air bag component manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, informed the luxury automaker that some of the Granturismo ECUs may <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V461-7448.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have been installed</a> with a faulty capacitor. Less than 24 hours later, Maserati launched an investigation to determine if this issue was isolated or systemic.</p>\n<p>The company ultimately determined that the problem was likely an aberration, as field analysis failed to specify a common link. Furthermore, no warranties, injuries or crashes were reported that traced back to the issue ZF Group made Maserati aware of in May. No customer complaints or satisfaction problems were filed either. Nevertheless, to err on the side of caution, the luxury automaker determined that a small-scale recall was warranted and informed NHTSA of its intentions June 14.</p>\n<p>Even though passenger air bags are increasingly sophisticated, there are a variety of reasons in which these systems may fail to deploy or trigger improperly, according to NHTSA. For example, using sensory technology, passenger detection systems are designed to turn on or off depending on whether someone is seated. If the person or animal is physically small in stature, the system may not turn on because it doesn&#8217;t detect an occupant. Similarly, if the occupant is seated too close to where the air bag is installed or isn&#8217;t seated properly, the air bag system may turn off.</p>\n<p>In the 30-plus years that passenger vehicles have been required to include air bags, approximately 50,457 people have avoided a fatal accident in the U.S., according to government data.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Maserati says it will inform affected operators no later than July 22 so that they can have their vehicles examined. If the evaluation determines the air bag ECU is compromised, a replacement will be installed free of charge.

This flaw could increase the risk of injury pending operators&#8217; potential involvement in a crash. Owners will be formally instructed to bring their SUV back to their area dealer so the assembly can be either repaired or replaced. The fix will come at no cost, as per usual for most safety recalls.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,&nbsp;the automaker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V350-9976.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">seeks to recall</a> 16,186 Range Rover and Range Rover Sport vehicles, whose model years span between 2016 and 2017. The genesis of the order stems from an apparent flaw with the driver&#8217;s seat belt emergency locking retractor. This component is what gives seat belts its protective capability, as when the brake is applied, it triggers the ELR&#8217;s locking mechanism, which is sensitive to movement. Some of these assemblies, however, may fail to perform should motorists be involved in a car accident.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>This issue first came to the automaker&#8217;s attention in November 2016, informed through NHTSA of a customer who noted that the ELR wasn&#8217;t triggering when the brakes on the vehicle were applied. Jaguar Land Rover coordinated with its seat belt supplier Autoliv, and they mutually determined that the safety flaw warranted further inquiry, which revealed that this was not an isolated incident. A customer from another automaker that partners with Autoliv also filed a 49 CFR 573 report regarding a malfunctioning ELR mechanism.</p>\n<p>An ensuing investigation revealed that some of the CLRs were not in compliance with existing federal safety regulations. However, they determined that the issues would not fundamentally increase the risk of an injury. NHTSA felt otherwise, and in May, ordered Jaguar Land Rover&nbsp;to conduct a recall on 2016-2017 Land Rover and Range Rover Sport models out of an abundance of caution. No known injuries or deaths have resulted from the flaw.</p>\n<p>Seat belts are believed to save thousands of motorists&#8217; and passengers&#8217;&nbsp;lives each year. Indeed, according to the most recent statistics available from NHTSA, the national seat belt usage rate in 2018 <a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812662\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">was nearly 90%</a>, up from 88% in 2015 and 85% in 2010. In 2000, seat belt compliance was just 70%. In most states, seat belts are primary laws, meaning that drivers can be pulled over by traffic enforcement officers for not buckling up. In primary law states, the usage rate is higher than those where seat belt laws are secondary (90% to 86%, respectively).</p>\n<p>In 2017, an estimated 14,955 fatal accidents were avoided in the U.S. thanks to motorists wearing their seat belts at the time of a crash.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Starting&nbsp;July 1, Land Rover will inform motorists of the vehicles in question by first-class mail in order to make them aware that their automobile may have the flawed seat belt assembly. A follow-up notice will be distributed once the automaker determines the proper solution. When the subsequent notification will commence has yet to be determined, but&nbsp;as noted above,&nbsp;the repair will be free.</p>\n<p>For more information on this recall and to see if you may be affected, enter your VIN at <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17058","createdAt":"2019-07-03T08:15:53.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-07-03T22:00:53.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-04T10:26:15.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-01-05T00:11:15.000Z","display_date":"July 03, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V350000","recall_date":"May 9, 2019","meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","custom_schema":""},"year":2019,"month":7,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Orange-Land-Rover-Range-Rover-Sport-2017-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Orange-Land-Rover-Range-Rover-Sport-2017","category":{"id":103,"name":"Land Rover","slug":"land-rover-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/landrover_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1431,"name":"2016-2017 Land Rover Range Rover recall","slug":"2016-2017-land-rover-range-rover-recall"},{"id":1432,"name":"2016-2017 Land Rover Range Rover Sport recall","slug":"2016-2017-land-rover-range-rover-sport-recall"},{"id":1433,"name":"Land Rover seatbelt recall","slug":"land-rover-seatbelt-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":103,"name":"Land Rover","slug":"land-rover-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/landrover_RM.png"}]}]
