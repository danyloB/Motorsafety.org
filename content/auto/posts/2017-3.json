Metal debris generated at the time of the production of the crankshaft were not removed. Additionally, fabricators left crankpins with uneven surfaces, giving them the potential to restrict oil flow to engine bearings. This raises internal temperatures and erodes the bearings. Together, these defects increase the likelihood of sudden engine failure, putting motorists at risk. No <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V224-3802.pdf?_ga=1.102830272.1131574040.1485543279\">injuries or accidents</a> have been connected to these defects, according to the NHTSA.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2015, Kia officials learned that Hyundai had to issue a recall to address problems stemming from Theta engines. Engineers for Kia evaluated models with these engines and reviewed production processes to look for similar problems. No significant issues materialized. Additionally, field and warranty claims remained at normal levels, indicating that Kia vehicles did not exhibit the same defects. Engineers at Kia production facilities in Hwasung, South Korea and West Point, Georgia had implemented line in August improvements to address possible engine issues.</li>\n<li>Between January and April 2016, Theta engine manufacturer Translead reviewed its production processes and discovered minor oil delivery problems. Kia implemented a monitoring program.</li>\n<li>In early May, Kia evaluated field performance data for the Theta engine and observed a slight uptick in claims detailing stalling precipitated by knocking noises. The carmaker decided to extend its warranty program. Over the course of late May and early June, Kia advised customers to take advantage of the program and bring their vehicles in for repair.</li>\n<li>Throughout the rest of the summer and fall, the carmaker continued its outreach program and addressed notification processing issues.</li>\n<li>In December 2016, Kia engineers reviewed more field data and field claims, the latter of which have decreased in volume due to the new warranty program and customer outreach efforts.</li>\n<li>Kia conducted further tests and evaluations throughout December and March 2017. On March 28, the automaker initiated a voluntary safety recall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Kia will instruct dealers to inspect engines in affected models and replace them should they show signs of damage. The carmaker intends to reimburse owners for the repairs via its warranty program, updated March 21, 2016. Dealers are expected to receive notification on May 22, while owners will be notified through first-class mail May 25.<script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10814","createdAt":"2017-03-31T11:17:24.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-04-01T01:02:24.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-31T07:51:41.000Z","modified_gmt":"2022-01-31T21:36:41.000Z","display_date":"March 31, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":"","meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","custom_schema":""},"year":2017,"month":3,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shutterstock_648551872-2-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_648551872-2","category":{"id":32,"name":"Kia","slug":"kia-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kia_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":32,"name":"Kia","slug":"kia-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kia_RM.png"}]},{"id":10580,"title":"Kia Issues Recall Due to Defective Vacuum Hose","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-issues-recall-due-defective-vacuum-hose/","status":"publish","slug":"kia-issues-recall-due-defective-vacuum-hose","excerpt":"<p>Kia Motors America has recalled a number of vehicles equipped with defective vacuum hoses.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Irvine, Calif. &#8211; March 31, 2017 &#8211;</em> Kia Motors America has recalled a number of vehicles equipped with defective vacuum hoses. The recall affects Cadenza <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V190-4269.PDF?_ga=1.26755005.1450630800.1490618357\">midsize sedans</a> produced between January and March 2017, according to documentation filed with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected models include improperly formed rubber vacuum hoses. Because these fixtures, which connect to brake boosters, were not fabricated correctly, they exhibit decreased elasticity and are therefore prone to kinking. When normal vacuum is circulated through these hoses, the flow is partially blocked, making it difficult for drivers to press down upon and operate the brake pedal. This lengthens braking distances, putting owners at risk and increasing the likelihood of a crash. However, no injuries have been connected to this defect.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Events</strong></h3>\n<p>On March 6, Kia motors <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V190-9458.pdf?_ga=1.71670675.1450630800.1490618357\">received a complaint</a> from an owner who had purchased his vehicle in Korea, according to the NHTSA. In the submission, the owner reported having difficulties when braking. The car maker immediately contacted the OEM parts provider that manufactured the vacuum hose assemblies and requested that the company, Hwasung R&amp;A in Korea, review its production records to assess the components mentioned in the complaint. It traced the vacuum hose in the car back to a batch of parts produced Dec. 30, 2016. Hwasung reviewed its fabrication processes and discovered that the hose did not have time to fully form, which could cause kinking. The parts producer had noticed the problem at the time of production and modified its workflows to address the issue.</p>\n<p>One day later, Kia evaluated the vacuum hoses at its production facility. During the first round of reviews, no&nbsp;Hwasung-made models from the Dec. 30 group were found. However, another pass showed that the hoses had been installed in Cadenza sedans assembled between January and March 2017. On March 9, the car maker decided to initiate a voluntary recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Kia has ordered dealers to evaluate the vacuum hoses in affected models and replace them should they belong to the batch produced Dec. 30, 2016. The car maker has pledged to reimburse owners for the repairs via its&nbsp;General Reimbursement Plan. Dealers are expected to receive notification of the recall April 10. Owners will receive notification through first-class mail April 17. Those in need of immediate assistance are encouraged to contact Kia customer service or call the NHTSA safety hotline.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10580","createdAt":"2017-03-31T04:18:25.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-03-31T18:03:25.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T03:25:10.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T17:10:10.000Z","display_date":"March 31, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":3,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shutterstock_399547738-1-768x511.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_399547738-1","category":{"id":32,"name":"Kia","slug":"kia-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kia_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":32,"name":"Kia","slug":"kia-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kia_RM.png"}]},{"id":10596,"title":"Mercedes Recalls Smart Cars With Defective Headlamps","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-recalls-smart-cars-defective-headlamps/","status":"publish","slug":"mercedes-recalls-smart-cars-defective-headlamps","excerpt":"<p>Mercedes Benz USA has recalled more than 2,200 vehicles with defective headlamps.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Montvale, N.J. &#8211; March 31, 2017 &#8211;</em> Mercedes-Benz USA has recalled more than 2,200 vehicles with defective headlamps.

On May 9, BMW issued an official voluntary recall.</p>\n<p>The car company continued to monitor the situation as the recall progressed. Additionally, engineers evaluated driveshaft assemblies from other vehicles and compiled reviews. Over the course of November and December 2016, BMW officials reviewed the findings and found that other vehicles suffered from issues present in models involved in the&nbsp;2014 quality assurance campaign. On Feb. 23, the automaker launched the latest recall.

Soon after, Roush initiated an internal investigation to better understand the problem and identify a solution.</p>\n<p>The firm evaluated fuel control valves in the Parker inventory, focusing on the state of the solenoid wiring coils. Roush discovered that, due to the placement of a small plastic bobbin, the coil wiring was slightly eschew. This failed to create enough distance between the wiring and the metal coil casting, leading to the over-current and short-to-ground performance. The parts had gone through the inspection process without being flagged.</p>\n<p>Roush decided to issue a recall March 8, 2017, following its investigation.

For example, vehicles that have sustained engine or transmission damage, and have blocked starters as a result, may experience high-voltage electrical currents when started repeatedly. This can damage the limiter, and in some cases&nbsp;melt surrounding components and catch fire. This increases the likelihood of occupant injury.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Daimler AMG, Mercedes&#8217; parent company, received reports of limiter damage in June 2016. The automaker launched an investigation and in August determined that the damage resulted from electrical overload. Over the course of September and October, engineers for Daimler&nbsp;preformed further tests. In November, the company learned that the limiter was not designed to handle high-voltage currents generated during repeat starts. Two months later, engineers determined the range of affected vehicles. Last month, Daimler issued an official recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The automaker has ordered dealers to install <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V114-9582.pdf?_ga=1.179040612.1131574040.1485543279\">an additional fuse</a> within the starter electrical lines in affected models, according to documents filed with the NHTSA.

This normally occurs when the vehicles are traveling 2 miles per hour or slower, such as in heavy, bumper-to-bumper traffic. This fault increases the likelihood of crash, especially when road conditions improve, causing trailing drivers to accelerate rapidly. Even so, no injuries have occurred as a result of the software defect.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>On Oct. 18, 2016, Maserati North America received a complaint from one driver who claimed his vehicle shifted into neutral without his assistance. The car maker immediately opened an investigation into the report and called for testing in an attempt to replicate and evaluate the possible issue. These trials concluded Nov. 9. Engineers were indeed able to replicate the issue, ordering follow-up diagnostics to better understand the underlying cause. These tests indicated that the engine software was to blame.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 9, developers at the car company announced that they had coded and validated a patch to address the glitch. Over the next five days, engineers performed emissions tests on vehicles with the updated software to ensure that exhaust levels remained in step with federal regulations. The new software had no impact on emissions and was approved for use.</p>\n<p>Maserati North America issued an initial recall on December 11, 2016. However, field tests revealed that the problem still persisted, despite the patch. Between Dec. 14 and Jan. 20, 2017, engineers and programmers replicated the issue on site and developed a newer iteration of the engine software that worked.

Consequently, the microgas&nbsp;generators contained within these fixtures may also disconnect and become airborne within the cabin, putting passengers at risk. While the pretensioners addressed in this recall are installed in a whole range of Audi models, engineers have discovered that microgas generators only come loose in A5 and S5 cabriolets. This is a result of ineffective crimping unique to these vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In December 2016, Autoliv, the OEM manufacturer that supplied the safety belt pretensioner assemblies, notified Volkswagen that its products were defective due to an assembly line oversight. It also communicated that a 573 report on its pretensioners and microgas generators was forthcoming. Members of the car maker&#8217;s&nbsp;Product Safety Committee discussed the matter over multiple sessions that took place throughout December 2016 and January 2017. The group ultimately decided there was not enough data to call for a voluntary recall and asked Autoliv to supply further information.</p>\n<p>The parts producer submitted specific serial numbers for installed pretensioners and microgas generators in January. Volkswagen engineers reviewed the information and conducted field tests that lasted through the following month. On March 1, the auto manufacturer decided to initiate a voluntary recall for Audi A5 and S5 models, both of which performed poorly in trials.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Volkswagen will order dealers to replace defective safety belt pretensioners and microgas generators.

This defect may cause the door to open when subjected to inertia loads of 30gs or more. Motorists involved in accidents that impact the driver side are likely to suffer serious injury due to the faulty door handle. However, there have been no reported injuries connected to the defect.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In early January, a tier-two supplier noticed a missing spring in the&nbsp;left-hand door latch assembly designated for the Mustang. The company began an internal investigation, notifying both Ford and the original OEM parts producer, Key Plastics of&nbsp;Felton, Pennsylvania. Key Plastics immediately froze shipments containing the component and started its own inquiry. At the same time, engineers at the Ford assembly plant in&nbsp;Flat Rock, Michigan, found one vehicle containing a left-hand door handle with loose springs. This lead to a widespread evaluation in which 843 vehicles were reviewed. Approximately 14 contained the defective door handle assembly.</p>\n<p>In February, the Critical Concerns Review Group at Ford looked over the data collected and determined that the fixture may be in violation of one or more Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The body ordered tests to determine how the door handles performed with one loose or missing spring. Engineers conducted the trials in early March and determined that the fixture was a serious safety hazard, as it came unlatched when subjected to a 30g force.</p>\n<p>The Field Review Committee looked over the test results and&nbsp;soon after recommended that vehicles containing the defective left-hand door assemblies be recalled. Dealers received notification March 14.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford has ordered dealers to inspect affected models and <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V168-9648.pdf?_ga=1.38080675.1450630800.1490618357\">replace door handle springs</a>, if necessary, free of charge, according to the NHTSA.

Inspectors calculated a projected failure rate of .085 percent and established that serious problems began developing after the 60,000 mile mark.</p>\n<p>Three months later, Isuzu engineers reviewed production protocols and added a new phase to fabrication process, which required shop-floor personnel to grind away burred edges. They also conducted road tests to replicate the issue. In June, the car manufacturer decided the problem posed few safety risks but continued to investigate.</p>\n<p>Further testing occurred throughout fall 2016 and winter 2017.

In the event of a crash, these fixtures can rupture, propelling sharp metal fragments throughout the cabin and causing serious harm to drivers and passengers. Inspectors have since connected the problem to shoddy fabrication practices in plants in Monclova, Mexico and LaGrange, Georgia. While no BMW drivers or passengers have been harmed due to Takata air bag equipment, the defective fixtures have injured and killed individuals operating vehicles from other manufacturers.</p>\n<p>On January 21, 2016, Takata announced that some vehicles in the U.S. contained faulty air bar inflators and propellant tablets. BMW reviewed the announcement and discovered that some of its models contained PSDI-5 inflators, which were indeed deemed defective by Takata engineers. This equipment had originated from the Monclova and LaGrange facilities, as well as another Takata production hub located in Freiberg, Germany. BMW reviewed its fabrication records and decided to issue a recall. The automaker notified dealers February 5.</p>\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n<p>BMW has ordered dealers to replace the front driver-side air bag assembly, free of charge.
