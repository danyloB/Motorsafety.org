The cars have defective modules in their seat-mounted side-impact airbags that may cause the fabric of the airbag cushions to tear during deployment. This increases the risk that the airbags will not perform as designed, threatening the safety of the vehicles&#8217; occupants.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>June 13, 2016 &#8211; Airbag supplier Takata discovered the fabric tear during a routine Lot Acceptance Test. Takata informed General Motors and then quarantined the entire shipment of supplies to confirm that the module was the cause of the problem. Specifically, the inflator may have been loaded with more propellant than necessary.</li>\n<li>June 24, 2016 &#8211; General Motors opened an investigation into the issue after a report was filed on its Speak Up for Safety System.</li>\n<li>July 13, 2016 &#8211; General Motors assigned a product investigator to look closely into the module issue.</li>\n<li>Aug.&nbsp;11, 2016 &#8211; General Motors learned that other inflators&nbsp;not included in the original quarantine may have similar problems, requiring further testing. The company&#8217;s Open Investigation Review then sought more data regarding the inflators.</li>\n<li>Aug.&nbsp;26, 2016 &#8211; Takata told General Motors that it found 18 modules with inflators that were heavier than they were supposed to be &#8211; meaning they could contain too much propellant.</li>\n<li>Oct.&nbsp;19, 2016 &#8211; General Motors decided to conduct the safety recall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>\n<p>Chevrolet dealers will inspect side airbags and replace them at no charge if faulty inflators are detected.

These components have flaws that could prevent vehicles from decelerating as expected.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Defect</strong></h3>\n<p>Isuzu will recall vehicles from the 2014-2016 model years. The throttle pedals on these cars may get stuck under steel stopper bolts, causing the pedal to remain in the full-throttle position, according to <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM545121/RCAK-16V797-9931.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documents compiled</a> by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The driver had to hit the brake in order to lose speed.</li>\n<li>August 2016 &#8211; Isuzu received a warranty claim for another vehicle of the same model. Further investigation uncovered that some accelerator pedals may be susceptible to additional lateral force. In addition, the company reopened several prior investigations to see if there was a larger trend that had been missed. One pedal assembly was missing a fastener, while another had an excessively deformed bracket.</li>\n<li>October 2016 &#8211; Isuzu&nbsp;issued the recall for all model years where similar issues have been reported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>\n<p>Isuzu will remove stopper bolts and replace them with flanged plates that will be bolted to the floor. This will prevent lateral movement and lessen straining on the components. This will be done free of charge, and any customer who has already paid for a replacement will be reimbursed.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=8883","createdAt":"2016-11-10T03:07:39.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-11-10T16:52:39.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T01:49:46.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T15:34:46.000Z","display_date":"November 10, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":11,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_1558958357-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1558958357","category":{"id":12,"name":"Chevrolet","slug":"chevrolet-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chevy_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":12,"name":"Chevrolet","slug":"chevrolet-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chevy_ms.png"}]},{"id":8840,"title":"Subaru Addresses Potential Engine Fires","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/subaru-addresses-potential-engine-fires/","status":"publish","slug":"subaru-addresses-potential-engine-fires","excerpt":"<p>Subaru is recalling more than 100,000 vehicles for potential engine fires.</p>\n","description":"<p>Subaru is recalling several vehicle models in the U.S.&nbsp;due to engine problems that have the potential to cause fires.

The issue is an engine oil cooler tube that could have poorly&nbsp;designed or insufficient crimps, which could lead to hose separation during operation. This could potentially result in an oil leak and engine failure. Owners could face an increased risk of crash&nbsp;or fire.</p>\n<p>As yet, Ford says that it has no knowledge of any fires or accidents that have been caused by this defect.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline Of Events</strong></h3>\n<p>August 2016 &#8211; Ford received reports of an engine oil cooler tube replacement. The Ford Critical Concern Review Group determined that the hose in question had separated from a crimp joint.</p>\n<p>September-October 2016 &#8211; Ford&#8217;s engineering teams attempted to analyze parts collected from the field, and determined that the hoses had not been secured properly. Specifically, the crimp process was conducted improperly, making it difficult to control crimp jaw location and hose insertion depth.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>\n<p>Ford will soon notify owners of the recall, and will begin the repair process Dec. 12, 2016. Ford will replace the engine oil cooler tube at no cost to owners. Meanwhile, AutoBlog reports that Shelby GT350 Mustangs are still available for purchase, though they will not be delivered to customers and may not be driven until new parts are procured.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=8838","createdAt":"2016-11-08T02:21:08.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-11-08T16:06:08.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T01:53:47.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T15:38:47.000Z","display_date":"November 08, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":11,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_100456645-1-768x511.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_100456645-1","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":8836,"title":"Takata Airbags In Jeeps Leads To Recall","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/takata-airbags-jeeps-leads-recall/","status":"publish","slug":"takata-airbags-jeeps-leads-recall","excerpt":"<p>Some Jeep Cherokees with Takata airbags will be recalled for faulty components.</p>\n","description":"<p>Fiat Chrysler has announced the recall of certain Jeep Cherokee vehicles after a problem was discovered that could prevent airbags from properly inflating.

The problem is that the threads on the tie rod can start to rust if a nut isn&#8217;t tightened properly. That causes the rod to break and drastically alter the suspension of the car. It&#8217;s dangerous to the driver because the car can veer off suddenly in one direction.</p>\n<p>The recall includes Toyota R-A-V-4s&nbsp;built from October 31, 2005, to September 7, 1010, as well as Lexus H-S-250-h vehicles built between July 6, 2009, and August 26, 2010.</p>\n<p>If you have one of those vehicles, take it into your dealership for a rear suspension replacement at no cost to you.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=8834","createdAt":"2016-11-03T04:16:29.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-11-03T18:01:29.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-29T04:40:53.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-29T18:25:53.000Z","display_date":"November 03, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":11,"alt_text":"","cld_public_id":null,"category":null,"tags":[],"categories":[]},{"id":8746,"title":"Toyota Halts Prius Sales Over Faulty Parking Brakes","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/toyota-halts-prius-sales-faulty-parking-brakes/","status":"publish","slug":"toyota-halts-prius-sales-faulty-parking-brakes","excerpt":"<p>Toyota will recall Prius models and halt their sales until it has resolved a parking brake issue.</p>\n","description":"<p>Toyota has ordered a halt to Prius sales after receiving reports that parking brakes may fail to engage.

Of these cars, about 19,500 have not yet been sold and are still in dealer inventory. The cause appears to be brake cables disengaging from the crank lever of the foot-operated parking&nbsp;brake pedal. If an affected vehicle is left in any other gear than &#8220;Park&#8221; while the ignition is on, it could roll away.</p>\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<p>In May 2016, Toyota began to receive reports from drivers about the issue. The end result was three separate Toyota field reports, as well as 64 warranty claims that are believed to be related to this issue.</p>\n<p>On Oct.&nbsp;12, 2016, Toyota filed a Defect Information report with the NHTSA, informing the agency about its voluntary recall.</p>\n<h3>Proposed Remedy</h3>\n<p>Toyota expects to begin notifying owners and dealers of the recall in November 2016, and the recall process itself will begin Dec. 11, 2016. Owners will be asked to return their vehicles to their nearest dealer. Toyota will install a clip at the parking brake cable that will prevent it from disengaging. This work will be done free of charge, as all affected vehicle owners are still within their warranty periods.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=8746","createdAt":"2016-11-02T03:35:39.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-11-02T17:20:39.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T01:57:50.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T15:42:50.000Z","display_date":"November 02, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":11,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_1497239645-2-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1497239645-2","category":{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"}]}]
