The campaign, which amends an earlier action initiated in September 2016, includes the following models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> 2012-2013 X3 xDrive28i</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2012-2013 xDrive35i </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n<p>Affected models are believed to include Takata front driver-side air bag assemblies with inflator modules that are incorrectly welded and therefore prone to disconnection in the event of a crash. In such a scenario, metal air bag components could disperse with a high rate of speed throughout the cabin, potentially harming or killing occupants.</p>\n<p>Car manufacturers across the globe have been dealing with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/business/takata-airbag-honda-death.html?mcubz=3\">this particular defect</a> for more than two years, The New York Times reported. Safety officials attribute 17 deaths and hundreds of serious injuries to defective Takata air bags. However, BMW has yet to receive any reports connecting the air bag inflator modules in this latest recall to accidents of injuries.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 20, 2016, BMW issued a safety recall with the NHTSA identification code 16V-683. Soon after, the automaker asked Takata to initiate an internal investigation aimed at reviewing air bag module installation records across all production sites. BMW requested this action after reviewing additional field reports and recovered parts. On July 20, 2017, Takata shared the preliminary results of this investigation, which indicated that two more air bag modules produced by the company could potentially harm passengers. Eleven days later, the parts manufacturer recommended that BMW issue a safety recall to correct the potentially defective parts.</p>\n<p>BMW analyzed its production logs and pinpointed models containing the air bag inflator modules mentioned in the Takata report. On Aug. 2, 2017, safety officials for the British automaker decided to launch a voluntary recall action. BMW notified dealers of the action Aug. 8.</p>\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n<p>The car manufacturer has ordered dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V495-8718.pdf\">replace the front driver-side air bag assemblies</a> in the affected vehicles free of charge, according to NHTSA documents.

Quality assurance reviewed the part and confirmed, via Nexteer records, that it had passed end-of-line inspection before being shipped to the assembly site. From July 21-27, engineers at the plant discovered three additional fractured drive shafts, all of which had also passed the final quality check at Nexteer. On July 28, officials at the San Luis Petosi plant filed a report via GM&#8217;s &#8220;Speak Up for Safety&#8221; program.</p>\n<p>Nexteer analyzed its records and discovered that drive shaft assemblies produced between June 13 and July 21 were scanned with improperly calibrated ultrasonic scanning equipment. The parts provider confirmed that drive shafts from this batch had been shipped to four separate GM plants, including the San Luis Petosi facility. GM then initiated quarantine programs at these sites. On Aug. 1, Nexteer delivered properly calibrated ultrasonic scanners to the GM assembly facilities, where all vehicle drive shafts were scanned.</p>\n<p>GM opened an investigation into the matter Aug. 4., and concluded the inquiry Aug. 14. On Aug. 15, the GM Safety Field Action Decision Authority called for a voluntary safety recall. The car manufacturer notified dealers Aug. 22.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>GM has asked dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V516-6977.pdf\">replace the front right intermediate drive shafts</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a document submitted to the NHTSA.

The automaker immediately coordinated an internal investigation with external parts supplier Kendrion Kuhnke Automotive GmbH, which provided the fuel pump assemblies in these vehicles. The two organizations asked DPAC to supply parts from affected vehicles for analysis. These items arrived in Wolfsburg, Germany, in October of that year. Engineers went to work analyzing the parts.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, engineering personnel presented their findings to the Volkswagen Product Safety Committee. The group reviewed the data but requested that engineering teams perform further tests to find a definitive root cause.

However, Hino has yet to receive any reports connecting the doors to accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On June 13, 2017, the U.S. Hino assembly plant received prefabricated vehicle cabs from a supplier in Japan. Engineers immediately noticed structural issues with the doors on these fixtures and identified the root cause: misaligned&nbsp;door hinges. &nbsp;Roughly one month later, the vehicle manufacturer began an internal repair initiative aimed at the hinges on assembled vehicles. This process involved installing shoulder-less bolts, repositioning cab doors by hand and tightening the bolts with the appropriate amount of torque. On July 19, the company adopted an alternative workflow due to high repair backlog, moving to an assembly-line based process that included the installation of shoulder-less hinges, along with a manual door adjustment &#8211; using a wedge &#8211; and bolt tightening. This last step was <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCRIT-17V493-0524.pdf\">carried out with the wedge</a> in place to ensure door fit, according to internal documentation filed with the NHTSA.</p>\n<p>On July 28, quality assurance personnel performed spot checks on vehicles with reinstalled doors and discovered assembly errors. Specifically, assembly and repair teams at the Hino&nbsp;production facility had failed to apply enough to torque when installing the hinge bolts, leaving them loose. Shipments were immediately halted. Over the next two days, engineers at the site repaired the vehicles with the amended door hinges by removing the hinges. On July 31, the Hino QA division elected to launch an official safety recall to address the issue.</p>\n<p>The vehicle manufacturer has introduced new production processes designed to prevent additional errors.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Hino has ordered dealers to tighten the door bolts on affected vehicles, free of charge. The automaker has not yet announced when it will <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V493-8647.pdf\">contact owners</a>, according to documents submitted to the NHTSA.

The campaign affects 2017 Jeep Renegade SUVs manufactured between June 1, 2017 and July 20, 2017. FCA estimates that 100 percent of the models referenced in the recall contain the defective equipment.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The vehicles involved in the campaign could be equipped with ICP software that causes warning lights to illuminate even when no engine problems are present. A newly installed integrated circuit chip system&nbsp;is believed to be the root cause of the error, which renders the affected models noncompliant&nbsp;under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101. The rule states that indicator signals &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/fmvss-quickrefguide-hs811439.pdf\">must not emit light</a> except when identifying the malfunction or vehicle condition [they are] designed to indicate,&#8221; according to the NHTSA.</p>\n<p>The defective ICP software creates a serious safety hazard, as drivers could be unaware of actual mechanical issues or other problems that may lead to breakdowns or accidents.

Two days later, officials from the FCA Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance examined evidence of the software error &#8211; video footage, in this case &#8211; and compared the issue to the functional requirements set out in the FMVSS. The internal group then connected with individuals from FCA Italy and expressed to them the opinion that the software did indeed pose a serious safety hazard and was in violation of FMVSS 101.</p>\n<p>On July 26, FCA chose to conduct an official safety recall. The automaker notified dealers Aug. 2.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The car company has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V485-5614.pdf\">update the ICP software</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgement filed with the NHTSA.

The campaign affects 2017 Dodge Charger and Challenger sports cars equipped with eight-cylinder Hellcat performance engines. FCA suspects 10 percent of the total number of vehicles referenced in the recall contain the defective parts.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The models involved in this recall are equipped with engines whose&nbsp;engine oil cooler lines are not properly joined. Specifically, on the section of the EOC&nbsp;lines where chlorinated polyethylene hose meets aluminum tubing, the joints are not suitably crimped. This can lead to line separation and engine oil spillage, resulting in engine seizure and the risk of fire. Additionally, drivers may lose visibility due to oil spray covering the windshield. All of these outcomes pose serious safety hazards to drivers and increase the risk of an accident. However, FCA has not received any reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries thus far.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On May 13, 2017, engineers at the FCA assembly plant in Ontario, Canada, initiated a product recall after receiving <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V496-2248.pdf\">three warranty claims</a> mentioning EOC line separation, according to a chronology document submitted to the NHTSA. The FCA&nbsp;Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance division immediately launched an investigation to better understand the consequences of the issue. On May 15, the parts supplier, Hutchings Automotive Products, performed production tests to determine if increasing the adhesive temperature during assembly would improve the structural integrity of the EOC line connections. These trials failed. Fifteen days later, FCA tested EOC line joints from aftermarket Mopar stock. These fixtures showed no signs of failure.</p>\n<p>Over the week of June 12, FCA conducted more in-house tests to pinpoint the root cause of the EOC line separation. More than two weeks later, dealers in the U.S. market inspected approximately 50 vehicles to determine if they were equipped with the defective parts and needed repair.</p>\n<p>On July 12, Hutchinson sent FCA results from an internal evaluation of the EOC hose material. The parts provider concluded that the material used to make the defective lines was out of specification. Two days later, FCA US Master Black Belt performed a parallel materials test and determined with 95 percent certainty that Hutchinson engineers were correct in their examination of the hose material.</p>\n<p>With this information in hand, the FCA Vehicle Regulations Committee called for an official voluntary safety recall Aug. 1. As of that date, the car manufacturer had received a total of eight customer assistance and information requests, zero vehicle owner&#8217;s questionnaires and zero field reports related to the defective EOC line.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA will direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V496-1610.pdf\">replace the EOC lines</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgment document sent to the NHTSA. The automaker plans to notify both owners and dealers on or around Sept. 22. However, owners in need of more immediate assistance can contact Chrysler customer service personnel at (800) 853-1403 or call the NHTSA Vehicle Safety Hotline at (888) 327-4236.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=11294","createdAt":"2017-08-24T14:55:16.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-08-25T04:40:16.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T04:22:02.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T18:07:02.000Z","display_date":"August 24, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":8,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dodge-Challenger-Scat-Pack-768x432.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Dodge-Challenger-Scat-Pack","category":{"id":20,"name":"Chrysler","slug":"chrysler-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrysler_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Chrysler","slug":"chrysler-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrysler_RM.png"},{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"}]},{"id":11296,"title":"BMW recalls vehicles with defective air bags","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-recalls-vehicles-defective-air-bags/","status":"publish","slug":"bmw-recalls-vehicles-defective-air-bags","excerpt":"<p>BMW of North America has recalled more than 3,000 vehicles believed to contain defective air bag assemblies.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Westwood, NJ &#8211; Aug. 24, 2017</em> &#8211; BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) has recalled more than 3,000 vehicles believed to contain <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V495-7172.PDF\">defective air bag assemblies</a>, according to documentation filed with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.

However, BMW has yet to receive any reports connecting the defective feature to any injuries.</p>\n<p>On August 15, 2016, BMW received notification of <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2016/RCLRPT-16V683-3710.PDF\">an accident</a> involving an X5 SUV, according to NHTSA documents. Investigators looking into this event noticed that metal projectiles had caused damage to the cabin. Engineers examined the vehicle and determined that the air bag inflator module had separated from its base plate during deployment, showering the interior with debris. Between August 30 and September 7, BMW and air bag manufacturer Takata met with NHTSA officials to discuss the issue. Early tests indicated that Takata was at fault, as the air bag inflator housing had not been properly welded during production.</p>\n<p>On September 13, 2016 BMW launched a voluntary safety recall. During this same time, Takata began an internal investigation into its processes.</p>\n<p>BMW received the preliminary results from this investigation July 20, 2017. The data indicated that the issue also existed in vehicles not addressed in the previous recall. Eleven days later, Takata confirmed this and recommended that BMW take action to ensure owner safety. The German automaker then reviewed its production records and compiled a final list of new vehicles containing the defective air bag assemblies.</p>\n<p>On August 2, BMW quality assurance personnel decided that an additional recall action was necessary, and launched another voluntary safety campaign.

However, Nissan has yet to receive reports connecting the noncompliant components to accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In January 2017, Nissan <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V268-7980.pdf\">conducted internal HIC tests</a> to assess the safety features on multiple vehicles, according to company documents submitted to the NHTSA. During these trials, engineers for the automakers learned that multiple models of the Nissan Titan pickup did not meet FMVSS requirements. In February, the NHTSA&#8217;s Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance sent an information request to Nissan asking for HIC readings. As engineers prepared this data, they performed further tests to ascertain the root cause of the readings and pinpoint any possible seat belt assembly defects that might have caused them.</p>\n<p>Nissan responded to the OVSC request in March and continued internal tests to see if the noncompliant readings created real-world safety concerns. Engineers soon discovered that the restraint features present in vehicles that registered&nbsp;HIC values over 1,000 were slightly skewed &#8211; specifically, the D-ring bolt trim caps and C-pillars were installed so as to create an approach angle of&nbsp;15 degrees, when the FMVSS recommended they be installed to accommodate an approach angle of 0 degrees.</p>\n<p>With this information in hand, Nissan established that the installed equipment created a significant safety risk and issued an official recall. The car company notified dealers July 31.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Nissan has ordered dealers to the seat belt bolts and bolt caps in affected vehicles, free of charge. Owners should expect to receive notification Sept. 26 via first-class mail.

The campaign affects 2014 Chevrolet Silverado LD pickup trucks manufactured between Jan. 30, 2013 and Sept. 4, 2014, as well as 2014 GMC Sierra LD pickups with production dates ranging from Jan. 29, 2013 to Sept. 4, 2014. GM estimates that 2 percent of the vehicles named in the recall contain the defective EPS software.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Vehicles referenced in the recall could potentially contain EPS software prone to sudden shutoff during low-voltage maneuvers such as low-speed turns. The software normally fails within a one-second span, when system voltage measurements drop below 8.8 volts. With the EPS disabled, operators have difficulty navigating the vehicle. This poses a serious safety risk to owners, passengers and other drivers. However, GM has yet to receive any field reports connecting the defective software to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Feb. 2, 2017 GM opened an internal investigation into EPS software installed in some vehicles after receiving multiple customer complaints and vehicle owner&#8217;s questionnaires mentioning momentary loss of EPS function. Throughout February and April, the automaker reviewed the collected customer complaints, warranty claims and VOQs to determine if the vehicles referenced in these reports shared similar mechanical features. GM did indeed find technical links between the models and launched an extended field investigation to gather more data, eventually discovering that faulty software was the root cause of the EPS failures.</p>\n<p>Over the course of April and May, GM engineers conducted internal tests at the company&#8217;s testing facility in Milford, Michigan in an effort to recreate the and evaluate the EPS problem. The automaker was able to gain a deeper understanding of the defective software and its impact on driveability. Engineers discovered that the EPS software stalled in particularly low-voltage situations and required at least 9 volts of electricity to maintain proper operations.</p>\n<p>In June, the GM Open Investigation Review&nbsp;re-evaluated the original reports collected in February. On June 22, the car company&#8217;s Safety Field Action Decision Authority announced that an official safety recall was necessary. GM <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCMN-17V414-2053.pdf\">notified dealers</a> of the campaign Aug. 7, according to internal documentation submitted to the NHTSA.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The automaker has ordered dealers to update the EPS software in affected models with a new iteration released May 19. The repairs are to be administered free of charge. GM plans to notify owners via first-class mail beginning Aug. 15.

The campaign affects 2016-2018 Q50 models produced between March 10, 2015 and April 5, 2017, as well as&nbsp;2017 Q60 models with production dates from July 30, 2015 to April 5, 2017. Nissan suspects 100 percent of the vehicles referenced in the recall contain the defective software.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The models involved in the recall could include FPCM&nbsp;software that references the incorrect fuel pressure map and, as a result, may not effectively filter gasoline from the reserve tank to the primary tank when its fuel levels drop. This could result in complete engine shutoff, as the small amount of fuel left in the main tank is inaccessible to the fuel pump. This scenario could increase the likelihood of an accident and poses a serious safety risk to vehicle operators. However, Nissan has yet to receive any field reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In December 2016, the car company received a report from the U.S. market detailing an Infiniti sedan that experienced&nbsp;fuel pump issues. Nissan launched an investigation immediately. More than a month later, engineers succeeded in replicating the problem in-house, using parts retrieved from the vehicle named in the initial report. In March 2017, the automaker launched a monitoring program to collect more data on the defect and assess its impact.</p>\n<p>One month later, engineers involved in the initial investigation submitted evidence connecting the issue to the fuel pressure mapping components in the vehicle&#8217;s FPCM software. Nissan amended the software at the point of production and then reached out to the NHTSA. However, the car company had not yet gathered enough information to launch an official safety recall and continued to monitor the field for more data related to the fuel pump defect. This program lasted until early July, by which point Nissan had collected enough field insights to initiate a recall.</p>\n<p>The car company met with NHTSA officials for the final time on July 12, launched an official safety recall July 19 and notified dealers July 27.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Nissan has ordered dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V476-8068.pdf\">reprogram the FPCM software</a> in affected vehicles, free of charge, according to internal documentation submitted to the NHTSA.
