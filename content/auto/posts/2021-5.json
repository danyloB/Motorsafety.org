Additionally, none of these models have been categorized as unreachable and 4,424 have been removed from the recall. All these Subaru models with ECM software issues were remedied between the second and fourth quarter of 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Camden, NJ – May 11,&nbsp; 2021</em> – <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/another-recall-ordered-for-subaru-impreza-and-crosstrek-vehicles/\">Subaru (OTCMKTS: FUJHY) has recalled 466,205 vehicles with an incorrectly programmed Engine Control Module (ECM)</a>, which is a component that controls over 100 elements in these cars. The issue may cause the car to stall, potentially leading to an accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Subaru ECM Recall includes the following vehicles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2017 Subaru Impreza</strong></li><li><strong>2018 Subaru Impreza</strong></li><li><strong>2019 Subaru Impreza</strong></li><li><strong>2018 Subaru Crosstrek</strong></li><li><strong>2019</strong><strong> Subaru Crosstrek</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The defective part of the vehicle is the ignition coil,&nbsp; part number 22433AA741.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignition coils are part of the car ignition system and convert the voltage of the car battery into energy needed to start the car. Due to faulty programming, the ECM is going to continue “instructing” the coils to do their job even after the engine is off. This may result in the coils short-circuiting. If this occurs when the car is in motion, the vehicle may stall, increasing the risk of a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall follows on the heels of a 2019 recall of the same cars for the same exact issue. It is being conducted again as Subaru discovered that the ECM reprogramming that was done last time was not sufficient to fully remedy the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stalling while driving may lead to potentially dangerous situations, especially if it happens in high-speed or dense traffic. Stalled cars are very dangerous and kill over 300 people a year on average, as reported. For tips on what to do if your car stalls while you’re driving it,<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-recalls-suvs-over-stall-and-fire-risk/\"> please see this recent Kia article</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signsSubaru recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the motion of the vehicle, when the occupants feel “irregular vibration.” This may mean that the vehicle is about to lose power.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other similar recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/nearly-a-half-million-subarus-recalled-due-to-stall-risk/\">In October of 2019, nearly half a million Subarus were recalled due to a stalling risk</a>.  Subaru of America recalled Impreza and Crosstrek vehicles – whose model years stretch from 2017 to 2019 – that may have faulty engine control modules. Specifically, despite the engine being turned off, the ECM may continue to run, a circumstance that has the potential to cause a short circuit or a blown fuse. This could lead to an accident if either of these outcomes takes place while motorists are traveling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will rectify the flaws in the programming of the ECM and will replace ignition coils and – in some cases – the front exhaust pipes as well. This will be carried out free of charge.

Just like how water beads up on the outside of a glass of ice water, cool air from air conditioning causes water to condense into droplets inside the air conditioner. This water has to drip somewhere, and the drain hose is supposed to move that moisture out of the car, away from sensitive wiring and electronics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recalled vehicles, the incorrectly installed drain hoses may cause water to leak down into the floor of the car. The electrical wiring there is not waterproof, and the water could cause an electrical short, creating the risk of a fire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Previous recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall builds on two previous ones by Mercedes Benz, who recalled 18,392 vehicles in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-a-class-sedans-over-water-damage-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3,615 in 2020 for the same issue in other models</a>. <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RMISC-21V288-3437.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mercedes blames the loosely connected drain hoses on a “deviation in the assembly process” during manufacturing.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the air conditioner drain hose is leaking,  <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V288-3873.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drivers and passengers may notice the carpet under their feet is wet, or that the windows are fogged up.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This water leak poses several risks. The various electronics that may be damaged by the water can disable features related to safety, like the emergency call system that alerts first responders if a crash is detected, and the door locks (which may hinder first responders from opening the doors in an emergency). If the vehicle is suddenly forced into a decreased power mode, the car may slow unexpectedly, creating the risk of a crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the risk of fire is serious, and puts passengers at risk of inhaling toxic fumes, getting burned or dying.

The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi A4</strong></li><li><strong>2019 &#8211; 2021 Audi A5</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi A6</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi A7</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi A8</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi Q5</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi S4</strong></li><li><strong>2019 &#8211; 2021 Audi S5</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi S6</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi S7</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi S8</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi SQ5</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Audi S5 Cabriolet</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Audi Q7</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Audi Q8</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Audi RS Q8</strong></li><li><strong>2019 &#8211; 2021 Audi RS5</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Audi RS6 Avant</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Audi RS7</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The component name is ”Lock nut M14x1,5,” part number WHT 007 610.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall stems from an issue with a single nut in the car’s trailing arm suspension. The trailing arms is a type of suspension that helps keep the rear wheels aligned properly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a supplier error, the nuts used to connect the trailing arm to the rest of the car were not manufactured “according to specification.” As a result, certain batches of nuts may get corroded or damaged, causing them to break.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the nut holding the trailing arm breaks, the rear wheels could become misaligned, changing the direction the car is moving in. “It cannot be completely ruled out that [the car] could suddenly and uncontrollably move in the wrong direction at higher speeds,” Volkswagen says in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V295-6898.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">recall documents</a>. If this occurs, the driver can lose control and crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning&nbsp;signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drivers with a broken trailing arm nut may notice the steering wheel is not aligned when they are driving or that the vehicle lists to one side when they hit the gas or brake.&nbsp;Volkswagen knows of two incidents of this kind; both took place outside the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Audi&nbsp;recalls</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen recently recalled over 150,000 Audi A3-generation cars for faulty airbags. <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagen-recalls-over-153000-audis-due-to-airbag-malfunction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">These passenger-side airbags are prone to deactivating</a> while someone is sitting in the seat, upping that passenger’s risk of injury in a crash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen and Audi dealers will replace the defective nut and will check for existing damage. If the part is already damaged, the whole screw connection will be replaced.

This increases risk of crash and may result in serious injuries to vehicle occupants.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Irvine, CA – May 4, 2021</em> – Kia Motors (OTCMKTS:KIMTF) is recalling 147,249 vehicles equipped with 2.0L Nu MPI engines, which may stall or catch fire while driving as a result of internal damage. This increases risk of a crash and may result in serious injuries to vehicle occupants.&nbsp; This Kia vehicle recall includes the following vehicles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2021 Kia&nbsp; Seltos</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Kia Soul&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Kia Soul</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The component in question is called “piston assembly,”&nbsp;part number 23041-2E801. This is the latest in the series of ongoing fire-related Kia and Hyundai recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The engines of these cars contain piston oil rings, <a href=\"http://korihandbook.tenneco.com/en/section_6.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">whose function is to seal the combustion chamber&nbsp; – where gasoline and air mix&nbsp; – from other parts of the engine</a>, partly to ensure that no extra oil is passed into the chamber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a supplier error,&nbsp; the recalled vehicles’ piston oil rings were “improperly heated” during production.&nbsp; As a result of this, they may become excessively hard to the point where they start chipping. This may result in the seal between the other parts of the engine and the combustion chamber breaking, which may cause extra oil to get into the engine and damage it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The damage may cause the car to stall while driving. If the car continues to be driven, parts of the piston assembly can break apart and pierce the engine. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V259000\" target=\"_blank\">This may result in the vehicle catching fire as oil escaping from the engine comes in contact with the “hot exhaust components.</a>”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The driver may be alerted to this problem if they hear the engine make a metallic rattling sound and feel it vibrate. In most cases, this will be accompanied by an illuminated “ oil pressure warning light” on the dashboard. To prevent any further damage, the driver should stop the vehicle in the first safe spot and turn off the engine. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stalling while driving may lead to potentially dangerous situations, especially if it happens in high-speed or dense traffic. Car fires are very dangerous and kill over 300 people a year on average,&nbsp; as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For tips on what to do if your car catches fire, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/2019-kia-stinger-recalled-for-mystery-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">please see this article about last year’s Kia Stinger recall for mystery fire risk</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Kia engine recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Kia and Hyundai have been subject to multiple fire-related recalls. Recently, the latter &#8211; which is part-owned by Hyundai and builds vehicles on its platform &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-recalls-cadenza-and-sportage-over-engine-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recalled over 300,000 Kia Cadenza and Kia Sportage cars because of fire risk related to a part within the anti-lock brake system </a>(ABS). Faulty engine rod bearings were the culprit behind a recent Hyundai recall due to the stall and fire risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seltos Kia 2021 is not subject to any additional recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, Kia Motors dealers will conduct a special engine examination in affected vehicles .&nbsp;If an oil ring flaw is found, the dealer will replace the whole engine.&nbsp;In certain cases, the dealer might also install software that will alert the driver that the piston oil ring is damaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall is slated to begin on June 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall includes nearly 150,000 Kia vehicles.
