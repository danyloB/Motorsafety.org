The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2019-2020 Chevrolet 4500HD Silverado Medium Duty trucks</strong></li><li><strong>2019-2020 Chevrolet 5500HD Silverado Medium Duty trucks</strong></li><li><strong>2019-2020 Chevrolet 6500HD Silverado Medium Duty trucks</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not the first time that a similar problem has occurred in Chevy vehicles, previously <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-trucks-recalled-for-a-software-error/\">the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 had been recalled due to problems with the ABS fault indicator lights</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 29, General Motors decided that certain 2019-2020 Chevrolet Medium Duty 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD trucks do not comply with a federal regulation requiring the ABS light to illuminate during certain kinds of malfunctions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicles use several control modules to operate many aspects of the car. GM houses many of these modules together in a grouping called the Body Control Module (BCM), which coordinates many functions in the vehicle, including the speedometer, the instrumentation panel, and the chime warnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another module, called the Electronic Brake Control Module (EBCM), reads sensors in the braking system and uses that information to activate the ABS as needed for sudden braking, stability, or traction control. These two systems need to communicate for the safety of the driver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recalled vehicles, the ABS light fails to illuminate when the BCM can’t communicate with the EBCM. This means that the driver will not be notified when there is a problem with the ABS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Chevy Silverado Recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this recall, the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-under-investigation-for-airbag-failures/\">2020 Chevrolet Silverado was among the cars recalled in April 2021 due to airbag failures</a> that failed to deploy properly during car accidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously In 2020, GM had recalled more than half a million vehicles including the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-vehicles-recalled-for-seat-belt-issue/\">2020-2021 Chevrolet Silverado Trucks due to seat belt issues in the front-row center seat</a>. General Motors began the recall on February 1, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important for drivers to know if there is a problem with the anti-lock brakes. Driving without the ABS, particularly in bad weather, can be dangerous because the vehicle may not handle braking on slippery surfaces the way it is supposed to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a vehicle skids, the tires lose traction with the ground and <a href=\"https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/218270/racv-abs-braking-system-effectiveness.pdf\">the driver can no longer steer</a>,<a href=\"https://my.chevrolet.com/recalls?vin=1HTKHPVH7KH124718#topOfForm:~:text=Safety%20Risk%20Description%3A,increasing%20the%20risk%20of%20a%20crash.\"> increasing the risk of a crash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected Chevy Silverado <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCSB-20V319-2276.pdf\">trucks need a software update for the BCM</a>. The update itself should take approximately 35 minutes, but GM advises owners in its owner notification letter that it may take longer “because of service scheduling requirements.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The repair is available now and is free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 12,000 cars are included in this Chevy recall.

The company warns that a faulty part of the engine compartment may increase the risk of a fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall stems from an issue with the engine compartment seal, a flexible strip that seals the engine compartment against the hood and helps keep the engine cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In “rare cases,” after being exposed to large temperature fluctuations near the hot engine, metal inside the rubber seal can warp and deform the seal. As a result, the seal—and possibly components surrounding it—can scorch and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V397-9422.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">cause a fire.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smells like trouble</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first sign of a problem for one Audi owner in McKinney, Texas, was a “rubber/plastic smell coming from under the hood,” the driver said in a <a href=\"https://www.audiworld.com/forums/a8-s8-d4-platform-discussion-190/engine-fire-recall-2013-1018-a-3001477/#16ef74d3-9484-4a4f-8af2-5edbd9406f6c:~:text=Holy%20smoke%20(pun%20intended)%2C%20this%20happened,love%20to%20get%20this%20fixed%20permanently.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">post to an Audi World forum.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I opened things up and the rubber seal (that seals the engine compartment against the hood when it is closed) had fallen off right above one of the turbo assemblies.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.audiworld.com/forums/members/dallasdave-372098/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">poster</a> drives a 2016 Audi S8 and claimed to have looked into the issue back in March, four months before Volkswagen issued their recall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V397-9422.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">became aware</a> of incidents of burning and warping&nbsp; seals in September 2019, but received no reports from North America.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you smell something burning while driving, stop the car someplace safe. Check the tires first. Wait for the engine to cool down before popping the hood to take&nbsp; a look&#8211; you&nbsp; do not want to burn your fingers on a hot component.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you suspect there is an actual fire under the hood, <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-243.pdf\">do not open </a>it. Oxygen will rush in and feed the flames. Instead, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/Public-Education/Resources/Safety-tip-sheets/Car_Fire_Safety.ashx\" target=\"_blank\">get yourself and others away from the vehicle</a>, at least 100 feet. Call the fire department at 911 when you are in a secure location. Do not return to the vehicle for any reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), car fires kill over 300 people a year on average. But, the number may be higher because it is often hard to tell whether the person died from the crash or from the fire. Between 2008 and 2017, vehicle fires caused, on average, <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fius20th.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">over a thousand injuries per year.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen dealers will install a retaining plate that will hold the engine seal in place and keep it from loosening. As of [date of publication] the repair is not yet available. Repairs may be forthcoming by September, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2018/AUDI/A8%252520LWB/4%252520DR/AWD#recalls420:~:text=The%20recall%20is%20expected%20to%20begin%20September%204%2C%202020.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">when the recall officially begins.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCMN-20V397-7796.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">customers can check</a> the condition of their engine compartment seal by looking under the hood to see if the seal is in the correct position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 13,000 cars are included in this Volkswagen recall.
