Though affected cars will still have a functioning warning indicator to signal to drivers, they could still be vulnerable to a crash due to a failure of the pre-collision brakes.</p>\n<p>As the NHTSA letter describes, the recall pertains to four specific brands from model year 2015 and one for 2016: the Impreza, Legacy, Outback, WRX and XV Crosstrek. The flaw can be corrected through a software update: according to USA Today, manufacturer representative Dominick Infante called the solution &#8220;really an easy fix.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Eyesight Driver Assist System is the official name of the unit that this recall concerns. The letter elaborates on some of the conditions that will <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM481240/RCAK-15V366-3604.pdf\">trigger the dangerous action</a>.<br />\n&#8220;If the switch that activates the brake lights fails, the automatic pre-collision braking component of the driver assist system will not function,&#8221; the source states. &#8220;If the automatic pre-collision braking system does not function as intended, the vehicle will not react to an obstacle in its path, increasing the risk of a crash.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even though a major recall-worthy action may be traced back to a simple software repair, the necessary actions for fixing the problem need to be corrected and taken as seriously as any other possible fault. Conducting a professional-level recall will take the proper message to the dealers and owners alike, making it less likely that the necessary actions will be confused.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://activetechnologies.us/rm/?p=3503","createdAt":"2015-06-29T07:19:05.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-06-29T21:04:05.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T23:49:59.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T13:34:59.000Z","display_date":"June 29, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blue-Subaru-WRX-STI-2015-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Blue-Subaru-WRX-STI-2015","category":{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"}]},{"id":14743,"title":"General Motors Recalls Cadillacs for Brake Pedal Bracket Problems","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-recalls-cadillacs-for-brake-pedal-bracket-problems/","status":"publish","slug":"general-motors-recalls-cadillacs-for-brake-pedal-bracket-problems","excerpt":"<p>Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) posted a recall acknowledgment statement to their website regarding a General Motors recall for 2015 Cadillac ATS and CTS models. </p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Detroit, MI — June 27, 2015 —</em> Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) posted a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2015/RCLRPT-15V358-4028.PDF\">recall acknowledgment statement</a> to their website regarding a General Motors recall for 2015 Cadillac ATS and CTS models. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The defect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this document, the affected vehicles brake pedal brackets subject to possible fractures, which could potentially fracture during a drive, putting the occupants of the car at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 2,160 vehicles may be at risk of this fault, and the official recall period will begin this August, and affects cars that were produced as recently as this March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with some of the other recalls MotorSafe has covered, the fix prescribed for this one appears to be relatively simple, since dealers can replace the faulty brake pedal brackets for free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the stakes for replacement are serious, since the issue could make it difficult for drivers to apply the brakes at all should the brackets end up breaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An additional recall safety bulletin from the NHTSA goes into further detail on the actions car dealers need to take to make affected Cadillacs safer for use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Dealers are to inspect the bracket for fracture or a condition that makes the bracket susceptible to fracture when the brake pedal is depressed,&#8221; it reads. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If a fracture or such a condition is found, dealers are to replace the brake pedal (including the affected bracket).&#8221; The statement also notes that a borescope is needed to help dealers successfully inspect for this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some auto recalls concern dangerous situations that may not likely happen during normal vehicle operation, this one centers around a feature that could be broken during regular use.

More information on this glitch was determined in November 2014.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The failure was determined to be a result of &#8216;short-distance combining processing&#8217; of the programmed logic of the CMBS system and an &#8216;incorrectly recognized target&#8217;,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;The failure was generated by another vehicle accelerating in front of the subject vehicle, while simultaneously driving alongside an iron fence.&#8221; Since then, the safety recall was issued last month, and so far there have been no claims related to this concern.</p>\n<p>Because of the long sequence of events that could lead to a recall, the speed and accuracy of the statement is critical and should be taken seriously with a high-performing recall system.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://activetechnologies.us/rm/?p=3537","createdAt":"2015-06-16T11:07:58.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-06-17T00:52:58.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T18:43:55.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T08:28:55.000Z","display_date":"June 16, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Modern-car-Acura-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Modern-car-Acura","category":{"id":4,"name":"Honda","slug":"honda-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":4,"name":"Honda","slug":"honda-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda_ms.png"}]},{"id":14752,"title":"More than 12,000 Ford trucks recalled for steering issues","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/more-than-12000-ford-trucks-recalled-for-steering-issues-2/","status":"publish","slug":"more-than-12000-ford-trucks-recalled-for-steering-issues-2","excerpt":"<p>Detroit, MI — June 15, 2015 — Earlier this month, Ford Motor Corporation recalled thousands of vehicles due to a fault that may affect steering.

The specific trucks included are F-150&#8217;s manufactured this year at its plants in Kansas City or Dearborn.<br />\nWhile the recall extends to all of North America, the company noted that most of the vehicles, 12,328 to be exact, were recalled in the United States, and only 5,600 of the total were actually sold to customers. Only 17 are being recalled in Mexico.</p>\n<p>The problem concerns the upper I-shaft in these trucks, which could separate from the vehicle entirely if the rivets attaching it are not held in place. In an official statement, the business  goes into further detail <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/04/29/ford-issues-four-safety-recalls-in-north-america.html\">about the complications that may arise from this</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If that happens, it could result in the loss of steering control without warning, increasing the risk of a crash,&#8221; it says, referring to the improper rivets. It goes on to point out that &#8220;Ford is not aware of any accidents or injuries, but is aware of one report of loss of steering believed to be related to this condition.&#8221; Dealers are fixing the problem by replacing the upper I-shaft assembly as needed.</p>\n<p>As Automotive News points out, a previous Ford recall related to faulty heat shields also involved trucks assembled in Dearborn and referred to cars made earlier this year. That was part of a series of four recalls addressed in a single statement on the company website.</p>\n<p>Understanding the trends in recent recall activity from manufacturers could promote a smarter and more coherent series of recall actions on the part of car dealers. Knowing the areas that are connected to previous recalls may help professionals address the needs of owners better and act on the recall.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://activetechnologies.us/rm/?p=3543","createdAt":"2015-06-15T06:24:34.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-06-15T20:09:34.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T18:28:08.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T08:13:08.000Z","display_date":"June 15, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ford-F150-Truck-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Ford-F150-Truck","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":14736,"title":"Volkswagen Group of America recalls thousands of Tiguan vehicles","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagen-group-of-america-recalls-thousands-of-tiguan-vehicles/","status":"publish","slug":"volkswagen-group-of-america-recalls-thousands-of-tiguan-vehicles","excerpt":"<p>Detroit, MI — June 12, 2015 — Documents on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website recently explained a new recall from Volkswagen Group of America.

This month, the manufacturer is recalling Tiguan SUVs that were produced within the first three months of 2015. As many as 2,957 units have been affected by incorrect information labels that may cause confusion among owners an operators.</p>\n<p>According to the source, these vehicles could bear incorrect certifications that list the wrong weight and loading limits information, in addition to omitting important details about tire pressure. In the official recall acknowledgment statement, Jennifer Timian, the Office of Defects Investigations&#8217; chief of Recall Management Division, said that owners could unintentionally overload vehicles that don&#8217;t have the correct information listed on them. Although the statement was released on June 9, the manufacturer&#8217;s report date is listed as May 15.</p>\n<p>In a separate FAQ document about this recall, Volkswagen gave specific instructions to dealers who <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM479850/RCORRD-15V311-9351.pdf\">may have affected cars to take care of</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dealers can use their most current OMD Web/VIM report to identify any affected vehicles that may be in their inventory,&#8221; this statement reads. &#8220;In the interest of customer safety and satisfaction, affected vehicles should be kept in a secure area where they cannot be made available for sale, lease, trade or demo use until this repair has been performed.&#8221; The remedy will reportedly include simply changing the information on the certification label so it is correct. Dealers will be able to do this for free.</p>\n<p>Verified recall information will give consumers and dealers the assurance that the information is accurate. The statements have to be disseminated to all the right people in each situation, so even the most minor faults are corrected on time and affected vehicles aren&#8217;t sold illegally.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://activetechnologies.us/rm/?p=3549","createdAt":"2015-06-12T11:24:12.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-06-13T01:09:12.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T23:31:13.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T13:16:13.000Z","display_date":"June 12, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Volkswagen-Tiguan-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Volkswagen-Tiguan","category":{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"}]},{"id":10773,"title":"More than 330,000 trucks part of new GM recall [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/330000-trucks-part-new-gm-recall-video/","status":"publish","slug":"330000-trucks-part-new-gm-recall-video","excerpt":"<p>GM is recalling more vehicles around the world due to airbag inflator concerns.
