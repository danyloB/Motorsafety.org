These fixtures greatly increase the likelihood of engine fire and therefore pose a serious hazard to occupants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Volkswagen has yet to receive reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Timeline of events</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Audi AG began receiving field reports outlining instances of fuel leakage throughout the fourth quarter of 2016. This trend continued into 2017, leading the brand to launch an official investigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2017, members of the Audi AG Product Safety Committee reviewed the issue and directed engineering teams to collect parts from the field for further analysis. This unfolded between June and September. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tests that engineers conducted during this timeframe  revealed that the high-pressure fuel pumps in affected vehicles were equipped with fuel lines that grew porous over time, leading to leakage. The Audi AG PSC evaluated these findings and called for an in-depth root cause investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between November 2017 and May 2018, Audi engineers analyzed additional field reports, all of which originated from the U.S. and Canadian markets, and conducted technical reviews of industry-standard fuel line assemblies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these tests failed to reveal the root cause of the defect. On June 18, 2018, members of the Audi AG PSC convened again to make a final determination on the issue. The group ultimately chose to greenlight a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Audi will direct&nbsp;dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V430-2303.pdf\">replace the fuel lines</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document.

The American automaker suspects 90 percent of the models involved in the action contain the defective parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The defect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected vehicles feature inboard child restraint anchorage bars containing excess adhesive. As a result, the diameter of these components may surpass factory standards and interfere with the installation of child seats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This defect poses a serious safety hazard to young passengers.

Despite these findings, the car company decided to widen the scope of the inquiry to include 2016 and 2017&nbsp;Cadillac CT6 sedans on April 10, 2018. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigation would also assess whether the flaw violated FMVSS 225.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of the expanded investigation, GM failed to find field reports mentioning 2016 &#8211; 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedans with defective child restraint anchorage bars. However, the car manufacturer chose to continue the inquiry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout May and June 2018, GM engineers inspected dealership- and employee-owned Cadillac CT6 sedans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also conducted tests to determine if the adhesive-covered bars inhibited child safety seat installation and measured these fixtures to determine if their diameters changed due to the defect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This investigation revealed several key pieces of information. First off, all of the vehicles that exhibited the defect seemed to originate from the GM assembly plant located in Detroit, which has amended its body adhesive application process in September 2017. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This production line change ultimately caused the defect. GM engineers also managed to confirm the excess body adhesive did alter the diameter of the&nbsp;inboard child restraint anchorage bars, making them incompatible with most car seat models. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the investigation showed that the bars did violate FMVSS 225.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 21, 2018, the members of the GM&nbsp;Safety and Field Action Decision Authority convened and reviewed the issue. After evaluating the data from both inquiries, the group chose to initiate a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GM notified dealers of the forthcoming action June 28, 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The automaker has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V437-6513.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">inspect the inboard child restraint anchorage bars</a> installed in recalled vehicles, remove any excess body adhesive and apply anti-corrosion coating, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technicians will perform this work free of charge.

This prompted the car manufacturer to launch an official investigation, which revealed that a number of 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 SUVs were indeed missing these parts due to incorrect assembly documentation.</p>\n<p>Daimler AG immediately reworked affected models remaining in factories and reviewed production logs to determine if vehicles without the required rear seat restraint anchorage points had been shipped out to dealers. This inquiry confirmed that such models had been released for purchase.</p>\n<p>On June 15, 2018, the automotive conglomerate decided that a voluntary safety recall was necessary.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Daimler AG will direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V405-2039.pdf\">replace the rear backseat rests</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document.

This prompted the automotive conglomerate to launch an internal inquiry and request parts from the model involved in the report for analysis. LEONI Wire Inc., the vendor that supplied the engine components used in the vehicle, reviewed the parts in November and determined that the pre-fuse box located in the trunk was missing the two nuts that secured its&nbsp;internal power bars.</p>\n<p>Daimler AG initiated a root cause investigation the following month. By the start of 2018, the company had discovered that a defective torque station was to blame for the missing nuts.</p>\n<p>Engineers for the conglomerate conducted additional tests to determine the impact of the defect. Concurrently, assembly specialists evaluated the problematic torque station to determine why an error had occurred.</p>\n<p>In March 2018, these experts concluded that defective software was behind the torque station mishap. Over the next two months, Daimler AG reviewed the wiring harness assembly that secured the pre-fuse box and combed through assembly log to see how many vehicles could have left the factory with defective parts.</p>\n<p>On June 15, 2018, Daimler AG reviewed all of the information related to the defect and decided to initiate a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Daimler AG will direct dealers to inspect and, if necessary, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V407-7934.pdf\">replace the pre-fuse boxes</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document.

The engineer then began releasing work orders in an effort to address the issue proactively and did so until March 14, 2018.</p>\n<p>On March 16, 2018, GM launched an official internal investigation. The automaker found that the GM engineering team had released two replacement PPS assemblies as part of the earlier repair initiative: one made for vehicles with vented seats and another made for vehicles with non-vented seats. Due to a part numbering mishap, these two components were mislabeled, meaning a number of dealers had likely installed incompatible parts in numerous 2016-2018 Chevrolet Malibu sedans and had unknowingly created a serious safety hazard.</p>\n<p>GM evaluated the issue May 25, 2018, and decided that a voluntary safety recall was necessary.</p>\n<p>The automaker informed dealers June 14, 2018.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>GM has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V400-3234.pdf\">replace the front PPS assemblies</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgment document.

The inquiry revealed that such an event had not unfolded. However, the two companies decided to conduct further tests in house to assess the potential for inflator rupture. These analyses, which began in January 2018 and concluded in March 2018, revealed that humidity-related propellant deterioration was possible. This prompted the ZF Group to launch its own series of tests.</p>\n<p>Soon after the vendor initiated its internal inquiry, it received word of another possible inflator rupture. The parts installed in the vehicles were&nbsp;from a suspect lot produced in 2002. This allowed Volkswagen and the ZF Group to narrow down the population of affected vehicles.</p>\n<p>The Volkswagen&nbsp;Pre Product Safety Committee reviewed the matter May 14, 2018, and requested additional information. Following the delivery of this data, the issue was passed to the&nbsp;Product Safety Committee, whose members determined on June 6, 2018, that a voluntary recall campaign was necessary.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Volkswagen will direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V406-5366.pdf\">replace the frontal air bag inflators</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document.

In the event that the propellant in these fixtures does deteriorate, the material may combust upon air bag deployment, exploding the metal inflator casing and sending steel shards flying through the vehicle cabin at high speeds. This defect poses a serious safety hazard to occupants.</p>\n<p>These defective air bag assemblies, 50 million of which <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/takata-recall-spotlight\">have been recalled worldwide</a>, according to the NHTSA,  have <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/massive-takata-airbag-recall-everything-you-need-to-know-including-full-list-of-affected-vehicles\">claimed the lives of approximately 23 people</a> and injured more than 100 others, Car and Driver reported. However, Ferrari has yet to receive field reports linking the Takata air bags involved in this action to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 3, 2017, Takata filed a Defect Information report with the NHTSA, indicating that it intended to recall a slew of new air bag assemblies installed in numerous models across multiple brands. Ferrari immediately reviewed its stock and issued a recall of its own soon after the Takata filing. In May 2018, the car manufacturers reassessed the issue and decided to expand its previous action.</p>\n<p>Ferrari notified dealers of its intentions June 15, 2018.</p>\n<h3>The repair</h3>\n<p>The automaker has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V381-2828.pdf\">replace the air bag inflators in affected models</a> free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgment document.

In the event that this occurs, the PODS system may not deploy passenger air bags during collisions. As a result, this defect poses a serious hazard to passengers. However, Volkswagen has yet to receive reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Volkswagen on Sept. 14, 2016, initiated an internal investigation after an active field monitoring program centered on the PODS modules indicated increased failure rates. Between October 2016 and April 2017, the automaker investigated the issue. Then, in December 2017, the car manufacturer requested engineering staff to develop potential solutions and called for a life-time field monitoring initiative.</p>\n<p>The Audi Product Safety Committee reviewed the matter in January 2018. The group then re-evaluated the issue May 28, 2018, and decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Volkswagen will direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V370-7818.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">install PODS repair kits</a> in affected models free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document.
