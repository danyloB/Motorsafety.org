This makes sure the insulating rubber does not get worn down, exposing live wires and damaging various electronics in the SUV. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a design error, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V534000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one of the wiring harnesses in the recalled cars might not be secured properly, potentially putting the wires in contact with the compressor of the car air conditioning (A/C) system, which is one of the most important parts of the A/C</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can result in the damage to the A/C and also cause a short-circuit that can grow into a car fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Lincoln and Ford recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first batch of Ford or Lincoln cars recently affected by faulty wiring harnesses. About two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/recall-announced-on-certain-2020-ford-explorer-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the automaker recalled over 10,000 2020 Ford Explorers for a near-identical issue</a> with the wiring harness and the air conditioner pulley. Lincoln MKX and Nautilus cars <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V414000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">were recalled a year ago</a> for a wiring harness defect affecting the airbags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020 Lincoln Aviator has been recalled ten times in total, including this recall. Prior to the wiring harness issue, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-lincoln-aviators-over-faulty-backup-camera-display/\" target=\"_blank\">the car has been recalled for the loss of the rearview camera image</a> and due to the risk of rollaway, fuel leaks and fire, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Read  more about the risks of vehicle fires, and what to do if one occurs, in <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-hybrids-recalled-for-contaminated-battery-fire-risk/#:~:text=Equipment%20failures%20accounted,traffic.%20Call%20911.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this article about a fire-related BMW recall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford and Lincoln dealers will install a tie strap to secure the faulty wiring harness out the way.

Collisions with civilian vehicles represent one of the leading causes of death for first responders and this investigation was opened on the back of 17 injuries and one death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigation could implicate 765,000 vehicles and <strong>covers the majority of Tesla models that have been made in the U.S</strong>., including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2017 &#8211; 2021 Model 3 sedans</strong></li><li><strong>2014 &#8211; 2021 Model S sedans</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2021 Model X SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2019 &#8211; 2021 Model Y compact SUVs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 13, the regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), opened an investigation based on 11 reports of Tesla cars crashing into first responders’ vehicles parked at emergency scenes on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the Teslas involved were using autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control (TACC) features when they crashed and most crashes occurred at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Teslas, which use eight cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors to monitor the road, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF\">did not stop driving, despite many vis</a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">ual signs of an emergency scene, including cones, flares and flashing lights on emergency vehicles.</a> At least in one case, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAB1907.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the car only detected the emergency vehicle just 0.49 seconds before it made impact</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scope of the investigation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigation will look into Tesla autopilot’s ability to respond to these scenes on the road and will also focus on how Tesla vehicles make sure that drivers are actually paying attention when autopilot is on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tesla’s autopilot is not the same as a self-driving car and drivers are still supposed to watch the road while driving.</strong> Tesla&#8217;s manual instructs owners to keep their hands on the wheel while autopilot is on. However, Tesla’s autopilot only requires drivers to occasionally tap the steering wheel to keep the autopilot running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, some autopilot systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.cadillac.com/content/dam/cadillac/na/us/english/index/ownership/technology/supercruise/pdfs/2018-cad-ct6-supercruise-personalization.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GM’s super cruise, use infrared cameras to monitor drivers’ eyes</a> to make sure they are still watching the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see an emergency vehicle, please slow down and move over to the right so that the vehicle can respond to the incident as soon as possible. Do not try to beat an ambulance or a police car at a light and keep your eyes on the road while driving. Keep in mind that your car is likely soundproof and you may only have a couple seconds to react to an emergency vehicle before it is too late. Do not engage in conversations with your passengers and try to avoid eating and drinking while driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Investigation process</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The safety agency’s investigation is currently in a preliminary stage that usually lasts under four months. If evaluators find a safety defect, the agency will escalate the investigation to decide whether to mandate a recall. This typically takes up to a year to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Tesla recalls in 2021</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this summer, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/tesla-recalls-almost-6000-vehicles-over-increased-accident-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla recalled Model Y and Model 3 cars first due to potential loss of tire pressure</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/tesla-recalls-model-3-and-model-y-over-risk-of-seat-belt-failure/\" target=\"_blank\">then because of faulty seatbelts</a>.

A large number of these vehicles were <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RMISC-21V473-7183.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first recalled in September 2014</a> over the same concern.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected component is the “adjustable rear suspension toe link” with part number 20867273.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected vehicles are equipped with rear toe links that may have been adjusted improperly during a service. <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-recalls-buick-and-chevy-cars-for-suspension-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A toe link keeps the suspension stable and the tires on the ground</a>, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the 2014 recall, the company continued to receive additional reports that the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V473-8845.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">toe links were still loose</a> and the NHTSA opened an investigation in 2020, after getting nine complaints from owners. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, GM has recalled all of the vehicles that were part of the original recall, as well as some additional model years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A loose toe link may cause the vehicle to veer uncontrollably. An affected vehicle may start swerving from side to side, increasing the risk of colliding with other vehicles and oncoming traffic. This is very dangerous. In fact, the NHTSA cited that two of the nine complaints it received resulted in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GM has mentioned that a driver will notice one of these warning signs if the toe link on their vehicle is loose:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Traction control, rear axle or Stabilitrak service message</li><li>Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) stays on or flashes </li><li>Chimes with any of the above messages and MILs</li><li>Vehicle sways or veers while driving</li><li>Off-center steering wheel</li><li>Uneven wear between the rear tires</li><li>Loud metallic noise from the rear suspension</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that you notice any of these signs, slow down and bring your vehicle to a halt. Have your vehicle towed immediately to a GM dealership; do not drive it there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Related complaints</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been several complaints from owners about losing control while driving. One <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=11268463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2015 Cadillac SRX driver reported a harrowing experience</a> where she and her husband were driving down the highway, heard a loud bang and then completely lost control of the vehicle. The car crossed three lanes of the interstate, hit the side of a tractor trailer, which pushed them back across three lanes and then came to a stop in the left lane. Fortunately, they came out of the incident unharmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other GM recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, GM issued a <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/category/gm-recalls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac recall for multiple models over a faulty airbag warning light</a>. All models were part of the 2021 model year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GM dealerships will replace the affected adjustable toe link with a non-adjustable unit, free of charge. This will prevent the toe links from coming loose or breaking in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers were notified on August 9, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A loose toe link can have serious consequences.

The airbag inflator might rupture, propelling gas and the inflator’s end-cap into the vehicle at high speeds, which could injure vehicle occupants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 1500</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016 Chevrolet  Silverado 2500</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016 Chevrolet  Silverado 3500</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016 GMC Sierra 1500</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016 GMC Sierra 2500</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016 GMC Sierra 3500</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected component is roof rail airbags with multiple part numbers, including 84487867 and 84487868. The bags were manufactured by a successor of Takata, Joyson Safety Systems, in Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The pickup trucks’<a href=\"https://youtu.be/YE2WaV66G4o?t=269\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> roof rail airbags deploy like “curtains” over the windows</a> to protect vehicle occupants’ heads during a crash. Inflators within these bags do what you expect them to do.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a manufacturing mistake, moisture “was introduced into the [inflator] vessel,” which may result in its corrosion. This may allow compressed gas to escape from the inflator and&nbsp; result in the parts of the inflator hurling themselves into the car occupants, causing injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Background of the recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially,<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/sierra-and-silverado-trucks-recalled-for-airbag-inflator-issue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> GM recalled a smaller group of approximately 9,000 trucks this past November.</a> The automaker expanded the recall in June after it became aware of three additional roof rail airbag inflator ruptures in Florida and Texas.<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V504-9818.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> General Motors noted that “thermal cycling” (i.e. very hot days and cool nights) exacerbate the defect</a>, making the inflator more likely to rupture. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the airbag inflator ruptures and the inflator’s end cap or other parts go flying into the cabin, they could hit vehicle occupants at high speeds, potentially injuring them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This defect is different from the infamous Takata airbag defect. Takata airbag inflators do not randomly explode. Rather,<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-ordered-to-recall-5-9-million-cars-equipped-with-takata-airbags/#:~:text=Recall%20summary,not%20appeal\" target=\"_blank\"> they deploy “too hard” during a crash, blowing the inflator to pieces that can impale vehicle occupants.</a> The recalled cars&#8217; inflators, on the other hand, explode because the container holding the compressed gas becomes too weak to hold it. This can occur at any time&#8211;not just when the airbags are triggered during a crash. Both are dangerous and should be repaired as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCMN-21V504-8215.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chevrolet and GMC dealers will inspect and, if needed, replace the right- and left-side roof rail airbags for free.</a> Owners will be warned about the recall by mail around August 16 and will receive a second letter once recall repairs become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 410,000 vehicles are included in this Chevrolet and GMC recall.

The heater plugs into an outlet and uses electricity to warm up coolant around the engine block. This coolant might leak out and come in contact with the heater’s electrical wiring, causing the system to short-circuit. The leak is caused by “contamination of the sealing surface” of the block heater during manufacturing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Previous recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the vehicles in this recall have already been repaired under<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V328-2215.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> another campaign in 2019</a> which addressed the same problem with the engine block heating system.

This may cause a fire, which increases the risk of injury and a crash. Vehicles involved in this recall include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2021 Kia Sorento</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Kia K5</strong></li><li><strong>2022 Kia K5</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/category/kia-recalls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">latest in a series of Kia and Hyundai recalls due to fire risk</a>. The component in question is the high pressure pipe (Kia fuel rail) with part number 35305-2S200.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicles that are part of this recall receive fuel through a so-called direct injection system. This is a popular type of a fuel injection system that delivers gasoline directly into the engine allowing for greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gasoline is transported to the engine via the fuel pump connected with a series of metal pipes called fuel rails. In affected vehicles, one or more pipes may not have been tightened during the assembly or may be out of shape due to a manufacturing error. In both cases, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V519-3079.PDF\">pressurized fuel may escape and spray on the engine and other nearby components</a>.    </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuel that sprays onto hot components in the engine compartment can easily ignite and cause a vehicle fire. This increases the risk of a crash, as flames and smoke may distract drivers and cause them to panic. Another risk is the inability to stop and leave the vehicle in time, which may lead to injury. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fuel leak would result in a strong gasoline, smoke and/or melting odor inside the car.

The dealer will check that the hub extenders are screwed in properly. If the hub extenders are loose, the dealer will tighten them. This inspection and repair, including necessary towing services, will be offered free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Owner notifications and instructions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford mailed notifications to owners in mid-June.

The issue may result in a loss of steering and up the risk of a crash or injury.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Franklin, TN – August 01, 2021</em> – Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) has recalled 138,736 vehicles with an issue that may result in a loss of steering and increase the risk of a crash or injury. This recall includes:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2020 Nissan Sentra</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Nissan Sentra</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected component is&nbsp; the “inner tie rod” with part number D8521-6LB0A.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A tie rod is part of the steering mechanism that <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/daimler-recalls-more-than-8000-trucks-for-possible-loss-of-steering/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">connects the steering wheel to the wheels</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On vehicles that are part of this recall, both left and right tie rods may have been damaged during manufacture, making them less sturdy.&nbsp; As a result,<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V461-7539.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> these tie rods may bend or even break apart</a> when going over bumps and other obstacles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how severe the damage is, bent tie rods may cause the steering wheel to be “off-center” and vibrate at certain speeds. In addition, a broken tie rod would cause a significant decrease in steering response and control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A reduction in steering response makes the vehicle less stable and responsive, which increases the chance of a crash or injury. This risk is as severe to the driver and its passengers as it is to other motorists and pedestrians.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Driving with any of the symptoms that indicate an issue with the steering system is extremely unsafe. If such a situation arises, you should get your vehicle towed by an authorized towing service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Nissan recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nissan had recently recalled certain <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/nissan-recalls-murano-suvs-for-loss-of-steering-falling-off-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nissan Murano 2020 crossover SUVs that had faulty control arms</a>. In addition, there was a Nissan Sentra recall earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/nissan-sentras-recalled-for-brake-light-malfunction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for faulty brake lights</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020 Sentra is not subject to any other recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, Nissan dealers will check both left and right tie rods&nbsp; and replace them if they are bent. The repair is free of charge. Notifications will be sent to owners around August 05, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This Nissan recall includes almost 140,000 of their sedan vehicles.
