      The automaker will typically send a mailer or envelope  labeled “Safety Recall Notice” when they recall a vehicle you own.
      <br /><br />You can proactively check your car for recalls on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) website using your car’s unique 17-character Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
      <br /><br />You can also search the NHTSA website using your car’s year, make, and model, but be aware that in some situations, not all cars with the same year, make and model will be recalled. Searching using your VIN is the best way to know if your specific vehicle is affected by a recall.
      <br /><br />You can also sign up for free recall alerts using a site like <a href="https://www.motorsafety.org/" target="_blank">motorsafety.org</a>.

    The manufacturer is required to attempt to notify you if you own a recalled car. Automakers use their own purchase records and DMV vehicle registration information to mail you a notification. This is why it’s important to keep your mailing address up-to-date in your vehicle registration.

    title: 'Why is a vehicle recalled?',

    Vehicle recalls are issued when an automaker or the NHTSA determines that there is an unreasonable safety risk with a vehicle, or decides the vehicle doesn’t comply with federal safety regulations.
    <br /><br />Most of the time, automakers proactively issue their own recalls when there is a safety problem. If they don’t, the NHTSA can compel automakers to recall a vehicle. Some recalls get a lot of press, like the infamous Takata airbag recall. But recalls happen all the time,  and most are issued without fanfare.
    <br /><br />Recalls are issued for safety reasons. Certain defects, such as leaking brake fluid, pose serious risks to drivers or passengers. Some issues, like a problem with an indicator light, do not pose an immediate danger to drivers, but are still serious and should be repaired as soon as possible. In the case of a recall, the automaker will offer a fix free of charge.
    <br /><br />Certain cars may have known issues with their quality or durability. For example, [example of a non-life-threatening defect in a certain type of car]  While these issues may be important to drivers, they will not result in a recall unless there is a safety risk.
    <br /><br />The defects that lead to recalls happen for all sorts of reasons. Perhaps there’s a flaw in the design of the vehicle, or safety testers missed something. Sometimes, there’s a mistake in the manufacturing process, and cars from a certain factory have to be recalled. A recall may be issued for a certain year, make, and model, but only those that were manufactured at a specific time or place will be recalled. Manufacturers can keep track of those specific cars using their VINs. If you want to know for certain if your vehicle has been recalled, you can look up your VIN with Motorsafety’s recall search tool.
