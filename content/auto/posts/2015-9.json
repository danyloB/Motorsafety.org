Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration discovered that some MINI Coopers do not meet government structural regulations established by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. Specifically, the low side impact rating in these cars would put rear seat passengers in danger. The recall will officially start on September 12.</p>\n<p>The affected vehicles have model years between 2014 and 2015. Fixing this problem will involve installing special material into the exterior of the vehicle to absorb the shock of collision. According to the NHTSA, some vehicles will also receive a small foam patch as part of the update.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=4298","createdAt":"2015-09-29T02:09:51.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-09-29T07:54:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T02:58:10.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T16:43:10.000Z","display_date":"September 29, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":6,"name":"MotorSafety.org","slug":"motorsafety"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":9,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2014-Mini-Cooper-S-car-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"2014-Mini-Cooper-S-car","category":{"id":31,"name":"Mini","slug":"mini-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mini_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1793,"name":"2014-2015 Mini Cooper recall","slug":"2014-2015-mini-cooper-recall"},{"id":1795,"name":"Mini structure issue","slug":"mini-structure-issue"}],"categories":[{"id":31,"name":"Mini","slug":"mini-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mini_RM.png"}]},{"id":10747,"title":"Second round of Nissan recalls could be forthcoming [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/second-round-nissan-recalls-forthcoming-video/","status":"publish","slug":"second-round-nissan-recalls-forthcoming-video","excerpt":"<p>According to the New York Times, 990,000 Nissan vehicles could be subject to a new round of recalls for an unresolved airbag deployment issue.</p>\n","description":"<p>According to the New York Times, 990,000 Nissan vehicles could be subject to a new round of recalls for an unresolved airbag deployment issue.

A single recall action centers on two specific brands of vehicles produced by plants in very different locations, one in Spain and one in Kentucky.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All total, the whole recall concerns 203,445 units in North America, specifically the Transit Connect Vans and Escape SUV&#8217;s built within the past year. The source says that affected vehicles could trigger a malfunction in multiple systems, including warning chimes. The same article mentions another, comparatively&nbsp;more minor recall for Transit Connect vehicles concerning improperly labeled seatbelts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While this second action only focuses on a group of fewer than 50 vehicles and hasn&#8217;t led to any known damages or injuries, the source says that the belts are still a violation of regulations and need to be replaced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These vans, acquired by a single fleet customer, have a special-order front passenger seat belt,&#8221; it states. &#8220;Though these seat belts work properly, the supplier mislabeled them. The labels don&#8217;t include all the information required by federal safety standards.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ford has issued other recent recalls for unrelated&nbsp;concerns in their vehicle lines, including a group of 393,623 vehicles with electric power steering problems. As Consumer Affairs reports, this issue requires dealers to investigate the&nbsp;Power Steering Control Module within the cars and replace them accordingly, along with the steering gear as necessary. This recall will take effect at the end of July and apply to several models, including the Lincoln MKS&nbsp;and Ford Taurus.</p>\n<p>Issuing recall statements within a tight timeframe will bring consumers and dealers more accurate information about the most recent and pressing manufacturer decisions.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=4570","createdAt":"2015-09-01T19:32:31.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-09-02T09:17:31.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T21:53:58.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T11:38:58.000Z","display_date":"September 02, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":9,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/modern-SUV-Ford-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"modern-SUV-Ford","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":14776,"title":"New recall targets Jeep wiper issues","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/new-recall-targets-jeep-wiper-issues/","status":"publish","slug":"new-recall-targets-jeep-wiper-issues","excerpt":"<p>Fiat Chrysler is recalling thousands of Jeep Cherokees due to defective windshield wipers.</p>\n","description":"<p><input id=\"br-article-id\" name=\"br-article-id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"40022349\"><em>Detroit, MI — September 1, 2015 —</em> Although it was technically noticed on August 31,&nbsp;Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is beginning the month of September with a new recall action concerning windshield wipers in some of its units. While this issue seems to be more of a concern for certain climates, the vehicles are being recalled from all over North America, including the United States, Canada and Mexico, with the majority of the recalls occurring within the U.S.</p>\n<p>An Autoblog article on this case, which quotes a press release from the manufacturers in full, describes the scope of the recall, which includes a total of 158,671 vehicles in the United States alone. Altogether, the total includes <a href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/31/2014-jeep-cherokee-windshield-wiper-recall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more than 206,000 2014 Jeep Cherokees</a> in all regions. More than 26,000 are located outside of the NAFTA regions in this continents, the source adds.</p>\n<p>If drivers in these vehicles attempt to use the wipers &#8220;during dry conditions,&#8221; the wiper control module could accumulate a terminal amount of static buildup, rendering them inoperable. This poses a special risk because the loss of function could happen suddenly, surprising the driver. The release also details the steps they can take to fix the issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dealers will install a ground strap to the control module to eliminate the potential for static buildup,&#8221; it reads. &#8220;Customers will be advised when they may schedule service, which will be performed at no cost.&#8221;&nbsp;There have yet to be any incidents traced back to this recall.</p>\n<p>Last month, the same manufacturer also recalled thousands of Jeep Grand Cherokees as part of a different concern over lower control arms susceptible to fractures.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=4555","createdAt":"2015-09-01T13:39:12.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-09-02T03:24:12.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T21:57:11.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T11:42:11.000Z","display_date":"September 01, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":9,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jeep-Grand-Cherokee-4x4-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Jeep-Grand-Cherokee-4x4","category":{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"}]}]
