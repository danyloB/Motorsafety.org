According to the Wall Street Journal, North America will see closer to 2.7 million vehicles recalled, as the manufacturer addresses cars produced over a five year period, beginning in January 2005. No serious fatalities and one minor injury has been attributed to these conditions, though there have been more than 11 cases documented in which fires affected the vehicles.</p>\n<p>In affected vehicles, fires could break out because of too-little grease on driver&#8217;s side windows. Components inside the car could melt, leaving drivers and passengers both at risk. Over time, the electrics can wear down and spark a fire, destroying or damaging sections of the auto, like the switch assembly. Vehicle models involved in this recall include RAV4s, Corollas and Camrys. In addition to these numbers, more than 1 million cars will recalled in Europe.</p>\n<p>The company has acknowledged that the fault could lead to a potential fire in target vehicles, and is not related to the Takata recalls that have affected millions of Toyota vehicles. The supplier in this case is Tokai Rika Co., a representative of which <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-to-recall-6-5-million-vehicles-globally-1445425401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defended the car company&#8217;s actions.</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We have been taking various measures to prevent problems from recurring,&#8221; this person said, as the Wall Street Journal notes. &#8220;But the recalled vehicles carry older components.&#8221;</p>\n<p>USA Today notes that Toyota has issued a similar recall in the past, centering around 150,000 vehicles from between 2007 and 2009.

The report also states that a mere 1 percent of the entire vehicle population is estimated to have the defect, and while the majority of the cars are distributed among the United States, several thousand others are in Canada, Mexico and other countries. Despite this varied area, the recall concerns just one make and model year range: Chargers from between 2011 and 2014.</p>\n<p>Unlike some similar recalls, there have reportedly been some incidents connected to this danger. The Associated Press said that the manufacturer has acknowledged &#8220;three potentially related injuries,&#8221; which, although minor, indicate some of the possible seriousness of this fault. The report doesn&#8217;t indicate a timeframe for this recall, but does state that the fix will involve updating calibration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To ensure consistency, FCA US, as part of the owner letter, will request that customers send the original receipt and/or other adequate proof of payment to the company for confirmation of the expense,&#8221; it reads.</p>\n<p>When a vehicle fault is tied to an easy trigger or occurrence, the best course of action is a comprehensive recall solution that communicates this properly.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=4879","createdAt":"2015-10-07T02:33:16.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-10-07T16:18:16.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T00:42:30.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T14:27:30.000Z","display_date":"October 07, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":10,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shutterstock_243626344-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_243626344","category":{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"}]},{"id":4889,"title":"Airbag failure leads to Volkswagen recall","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/spring-fault-triggers-volkswagen-airbag-recall/","status":"publish","slug":"spring-fault-triggers-volkswagen-airbag-recall","excerpt":"<p>A clock spring problem in Volkswagen steering wheels could prevent air bags from operating correctly.</p>\n","description":"<p><input id=\"br-article-id\" name=\"br-article-id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"40021482\"></p>\n<p><em>Berlin, Germany — October 06, 2015 —</em> Several different models of Volkswagen cars are being recalled due to an airbag failure concern across North America.

CEO Mary Barra reportedly didn&#8217;t learn about the switches until 2013.</p>\n<p>Back in the 2014 NHTSA press release,&nbsp;acting administrator&nbsp;David Friedman affirmed&nbsp;the organization&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/About NHTSA/Press Releases/2014/DOT-Announces-Record-Fines,-Unprecedented-Oversight-Requirements-in-GM-Investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dedication&nbsp;to pursuing proper actions.</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;No excuse, process, or organizational structure will be allowed to stand in the way of any company meeting their obligation to quickly find and fix safety issues in a vehicle,&#8221; he said then. &#8220;It&#8217;s critical to the safety of the driving public that manufacturers promptly report and remedy safety-related defects that have the potential to lead to deaths or injuries on our nation&#8217;s highways.&#8221;<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=4795","createdAt":"2015-10-05T02:16:25.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-10-05T08:01:25.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T22:43:11.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T12:28:11.000Z","display_date":"October 05, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":10,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Motors-Logo-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Motors-Logo","category":{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"}]},{"id":4797,"title":"FCA Recalls Dodge Darts Over Transmissions Concerns","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/fca-recalls-dodge-darts-over-transmissions-concerns/","status":"publish","slug":"fca-recalls-dodge-darts-over-transmissions-concerns","excerpt":"<p>A new recall stems from transmission concerns in certain Dodge Darts.</p>\n","description":"<p><input id=\"br-article-id\" name=\"br-article-id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"40023005\"></p>\n<p><em>Auburn Hills, MI — October 2, 2015 —</em> Approximately 23,688 Dodge Darts in the United States with model years between 2013 and 2015 are part of a new auto recall from Fiat Chrysler.

According to the recall report, nearly 7,000 vehicles with the model year 2015 are potentially subject to this action. Of these, the majority are Nissan Sentras, which make up over 5,000 of the total. Also included are 1,200 Versa Notes and 41 Rogues.</p>\n<p>In these autos, the door locks on the driver and rear left side doors may not latch properly. This is because of an error from the supplier, Magna Closures, and leaves passengers at risk if the doors open while the car is in motion. Nissan dealers will solve the problem by inspecting recalled vehicles and replacing affected door locks, a process that is both free and can take as little as one hour to complete.</p>\n<p>Thank you for watching, and please check back for the latest major recall news.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=4289","createdAt":"2015-10-01T01:03:19.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-10-01T06:48:19.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T21:46:39.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T11:31:39.000Z","display_date":"October 01, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":10,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/White-car-Nissan-Sentra-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"White-car-Nissan-Sentra","category":null,"tags":[],"categories":[]}]
