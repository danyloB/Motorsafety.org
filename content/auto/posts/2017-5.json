The campaign affects Jaguar F-Type <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V341-2185.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sports cars</a> with highline headlights manufactured between March 9 and April 18, 2017, according to documentation filed with National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. The automaker estimates that 100 percent of the vehicles named in the recall contain this defective part.</p>\n<h2>The defect</h2>\n<p>Vehicles named in the campaign are equipped with lighting systems that do not comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which stipulates that automobiles of all makes must include interior indicators to alert drivers when vehicle turn signals and headlight bulbs are damaged or in need of replacement, according to the Government Publishing Office. The turning signals and headlights installed on the Jaguar F-Type sports cars associated with the recall continue to function normally and offer warning even as essential lighting components quickly wane. This could increase the likelihood of an accident, as the driver may suddenly lose exterior lighting fixtures essential to safe operation. However, no accidents or injuries have yet been connected to this defect.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of events</h2>\n<p>The Jaguar Land Rover Product Safety and Compliance Committee launched an investigation May 9, 2017 following a post-production test in which the signal light failure indicator on one car failed to trigger, despite the presence of an inoperable lighting fixture. Engineers evaluated the result and discovered that a lighting assembly from German parts provider Automotive Lighting Reutlingen GmbH was the root cause. The engineers reported this discovery to the PSCC May 16, which forwarded the case to the Recall Determination Committee. This body reviewed all of the available information on the possible defect two days later and determined that the lighting assembly did not comply with FMVSS Standard 108. The RDC then called for a voluntary recall, and the automaker notified dealers June 1.</p>\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has ordered dealers to update the software in the affected vehicles to reactivate interior warning indicators. This work is to be done free of charge. Additionally, the company plans to reach out to owners on or before July 17 via mail. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check and see if your car is one of them using </span><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motorsafety.org’s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> free recall lookup tool.</span><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=11035","createdAt":"2017-05-24T18:20:25.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-05-25T08:05:25.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T03:17:17.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-27T17:02:17.000Z","display_date":"May 25, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":6,"name":"MotorSafety.org","slug":"motorsafety"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"17V341000","recall_date":"May 25, 2017"},"year":2017,"month":5,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_674800969-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_674800969-1","category":{"id":41,"name":"Jaguar","slug":"jaguar-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jaguar_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1735,"name":"2018 Jaguar F-Type recall","slug":"2018-jaguar-f-type-recall"},{"id":1736,"name":"Jaguar headlight recall","slug":"jaguar-headlight-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":41,"name":"Jaguar","slug":"jaguar-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jaguar_RM.png"}]},{"id":10962,"title":"Ford recalls trucks with defective aftermarket door handles","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-trucks-defective-aftermarket-door-handles/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-recalls-trucks-defective-aftermarket-door-handles","excerpt":"<p>Ford Motor Company has recalled approximately 551 pickup trucks equipped with defective aftermarket door handles.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dearborn, Mich. &#8211; May 24, 2017 &#8211; Ford Motor Company has recalled approximately 551 pickup trucks equipped with defective <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/05/24/ford-issues-two-safety-compliance-recalls-in-north-america.html\">aftermarket door handles</a>, according to a company press release. The campaign affects 2015-2017 F-150 pickups, as well as 2017 F-250 and F-550 models. Approximately 247 of these vehicles came from American dealerships, while the remainder originated from Canadian showrooms.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nThe affected pickups feature aftermarket chrome door handles sourced from third-party parts dealers. These fixtures, which do not comport with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, are prone to release during accidents, posing a&nbsp;serious risk to occupants. More specifically, the door latches &#8220;may experience inertial loads that could cause it to unlatch during a side impact,&#8221; according to Ford. So far, the automaker has yet to field any reports linking the defective devices to accidents or injuries.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nFord recently traced the defective door handle assemblies to dealerships in the U.S. and Canada. These facilities had installed the features on-site, partnering with aftermarket parts providers unknown to Ford headquarters. Consequently, the manufacturer requested that dealers review their internal records to pinpoint the companies that sold them these.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nIn addition to requesting dealer records, Ford has announced plans to issue communications to service departments so they can switch out door handle assemblies on pickups that come in for unrelated maintenance. Dealers have been ordered to replace the assemblies and reimburse customers for parts and service fees. The automaker has yet to notify the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and will conduct the recall internally for the time being. Owners who need additional assistance can contact Ford support personnel at&nbsp;866-436-7332.

The recall affects Ram 1500 and 2500 pickups produced between 2013 and 2016, as well as Ram 3500 pickups assembled between 2014 and 2016. Ram pickup trucks are the company&#8217;s best-selling vehicles, accounting for roughly 25 percent of all of the company&#8217;s sales in the U.S.</p>\n<p>More than 1 million of the affected trucks were sold in the U.S. Roughly 216,000 came from dealerships in Canada, while just over 21,000 originated from Mexican dealers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nModels named in the recall are equipped with faulty software that switches off airbags and seatbelt tension assemblies, presenting serious risks to both drivers and passengers. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-fiat-recall-20170512-story.html\">multiple accidents</a> involving Ram owners precipitated the recall, the Los Angeles Times reported. FCA has received reports of at least one fatality and two injuries directly linked the software error. In addition to this defect, FCA officials found that computer components could fail during accidents in which the undersides of the Ram trucks sustained impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nFCA began investigating the issue in December 2015 following an owner lawsuit, The Times said. The plaintiff argued that both the air bags and seatbelts in his Ram truck had failed during a roll-over crash. The carmaker called for an official inquiry. Engineers eventually discovered that the vehicle was equipped with badly designed software that could malfunction in accidents involving underside impact. Specifically, such collisions disrupt normal CPU processing operations and generate errors that ultimately halt computerized air bag and seatbelt components. FCA has <a href=\"http://speedlux.com/fca-recalls-1-25-million-trucks-concerning-software-error/\">declined to say</a> whether the problem is the result of internal or external production processes, according to SpeedLux.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nThe vehicle manufacturer has yet release plans for addressing the issue but has advised owners to carefully monitor their pickups. In the event that the air bag and seatbelt systems fail during normal operation, warning lights on the dash illuminate. When this occurs, owners should turn off and restart their vehicles. FCA claims this action clears the error codes. In the meantime, FCA has agreed to review its production processes and mitigate the issue with the help of a third party, as well as the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. The recall is scheduled to begin next month.

The campaign impacts Acura RDX and Honda CR-V models produced between April 3 and April 11, 2017. The automaker has yet to ascertain how many of the recalled vehicles contain these problematic markers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nAffected models feature certification labels that can be altered using alcohol or other caustic solvents. Honda engineers traced the problem to improper labeling methods, which included the use of incompatible printing ribbons. While not safety hazards, these defective labels fail to comply with <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2011-title49-vol6-part567.pdf\">certification requirements</a> established in section 567 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. This portion of the regulatory document states that a certification label must be applied &#8220;in such a manner that it cannot be removed without destroying or defacing it.&#8221; Additionally, the regulations require labels to contain key information, including the vehicle identification number, manufacturer details and general specifications such as axle-weight rating.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nOn April 3, 2017, assembly personnel at an unnamed Honda production facility&nbsp;installed an incorrect printer ribbon in a certification labeling device. Days later, a crew member affixing labels to new vehicles noticed the mishap and performed a spot quality assurance check to test label strength. The employee was able to rub off the ink using alcohol. Then,&nbsp;on April 12, QA personnel performed a follow-up trial and confirmed that an incorrect&nbsp;printing ribbon had indeed been used. This lead to a more in-depth inquiry, which came to a close April 18. Honda officials confirmed that Acura RDX and Honda CR-V models with certification labels originating from the faulty device were non-compliant with FMVSS. The automaker then&nbsp;launched a voluntary recall campaign.</p>\n<p>However, investigations continued. Despite the campaign initiation, QA teams had yet to understand the full scope of the problem. On May 11, after almost a month of review, Honda confirmed that the problem affected <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V256-5460.PDF\">more than 1,400 vehicles</a>, according to amended documentation filed with the NHTSA.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nHonda has ordered dealers to replace defective certification labels, free of charge.

The campaign affects SLC&nbsp;43 AMG, SLC 300, SLK 250 and SLK 350 models produced between March 19, 2015 and Feb. 3, 2017. The car maker estimates that 100 percent of these vehicles contain defective braking systems.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nThe models mentioned in the recall are said to feature improperly installed electronic stability program software. Under normal conditions, ESP software helps drivers slow their vehicles, intervening automatically to initiate stoppage when a certain amount pressure is applied to the brake pedal. When drivers release the brake pedal, the system switches off. Overall, EPS software helps prevent increased wear on hydraulic components and eases overall operation.</p>\n<p>However, the Mercedes vehicles mentioned above come with defective EPS solutions that fail to abort when the brake pedal is decompressed. This creates prolonged contact between the pad and the rotor and leads to overheating. When such a situation occurs, pressure builds and ultimately reduces drivability. This poses a serious safety risk to occupants. Owners have reported seeing smoke rise from wheel wells as a result of the issue. However, the defect does not reduce braking effectiveness or EPS operability.</p>\n<p>No accidents or injuries have been linked to this software error.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nThroughout 2016, Daimler AG, Mercedes&#8217; parent company, received consistent reports of brake overheating. In April of that year, the company created an internal team to evaluate the reports and search for an underlying cause. Engineers tested braking hardware but found that it met all mechanical performance thresholds. The grouped moved on&nbsp;to field tests and saw the same results, leading them to rule out defective hardware as the root problem.</p>\n<p>From August onward DAG engineers analyzed ancillary mechanical systems and vehicle software. In September, the internal team decided to design new EPS software to test against existing installations. By early 2017, the new program was complete and ready for testing. DAG initiated field trials and uncovered performance discrepancies between the two systems. In March engineers reviewed the EPS testing data and once again reviewed customer claims. A little more than one month later, DAG decided to launch a voluntary recall campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nThe car makers has ordered Mercedes-Benz dealers to update EPS software in affected vehicles. However, since the models covered in the recall retain their factory warranties, DAG will not be offering reimbursement for these repairs. Dealers received notification earlier this month. Owners with vehicles named in the recall should expect communications next month.

Approximately 10 were shipped to Mexico.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nVehicles named in this recall contain front passenger-side air bag assemblies with faulty components. Specifically, the inflator modules in these safety systems may hold defective coolant with diminished compression strength. As a result, the air bags may not inflate properly in the event of an accident, leaving occupants defenseless. Nissan has traced the coolant issue to two separate phenomena: oxidization due to ineffective storage methods and&nbsp;excessive wear from factory tooling practices. This defect obviously poses serious risk to owners. However, Nissan has not learned of any accidents or injuries connected to the faulty air bag inflator modules.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nIn October 2016, Nissan conducted safety tests and discovered that air bag assemblies in Leaf and Sentra models failed to fire properly. The automaker soon notified Japanese chemical firm&nbsp;Daicel Corporation, which supplied the coolant used in the fixtures. Daicel initiated an internal evaluation. Between November and December 2016, engineers for both companies reviewed the production workflows at the Daicel&nbsp;plant to determine the cause of the issue. The two teams also reached out to other suppliers involved in the production of the inflator modules, including Fuji and the Japanese vehicle design company Nihon Plast. The latter began internal testing.</p>\n<p>Nihon Plast completed its evaluation in February 2017 and summoned Nissan officials to review the results. As this unfolded, the automaker launched field tests to pinpoint any accidents that could have been attributed to the malfunctioning air bar assembly. Nissan ultimately found none. In March, Nissan completed its review of the Nihon Plast product evaluation &nbsp;and determined that a&nbsp;voluntary recall was necessary. The company launched the campaign April 6, 2017 but has since amended it twice &#8211; once April 28, 2017 and another time May 4, 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nNissan notified dealers April 27, 2017, requesting that they <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCMN-17V253-2824.pdf\">replace passenger-side air bags</a> in affected models, free of charge, according to an internal communication submitted to the NHTSA.

The recall, which is an expansion of two earlier campaigns, affects Audi Q7 SUVs produced between May 2012 and July 2015, as well as Q5 models that rolled off the assembly line from July 2012 to March 2017. The automaker estimates that this problem affects 100 percent of these vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nThe vehicles named in the recall are equipped with defective fuel-pump flanges that are prone to cracking. Should fissures develop, fuel could leak into the engine compartment and catch fire, posing a serious risk to occupants. Owners are likely to smell fuel while operating the vehicle or standing near it when leakage has occurred. There have been no accidents or injuries linked to this defect.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nEarlier this month, Volkswagen recalled a large number of Porsche Macan crossovers due to <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/vw-expands-porsche-macan-fuel-leak-recall-to-240k-audi-models/\">the same issue</a>, CNET reported. However, this fuel flange problem can be <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2016/RCLRPT-16V660-8597.PDF\">traced back</a> to a recall initiated in September of last year that included the Audi Q7 and Q5, according to the NHTSA.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2015, the automaker became aware of customer complaints and NHTSA filings that mentioned the possibility of fuel leakage. Engineers investigated these assertions and found that the vehicles mentioned in the reports had faulty fuel flanges that tended to develop&nbsp;fissures. Further evaluations took place over an eight-month period between December 2015 and July 2016. Unfortunately, inspectors were unable to discover the root cause. However, Volkswagen developed a workable solution to the problem: a butyl rubber film that could cover the fuel pump flange and seal off leaks.</p>\n<p>In September of 2016, the Audi Product Safety Committee chose to issue an official recall. Volkswagen has since discovered the defect in other vehicles, including the Porsche Macan, and has expanded the campaign to account for new models.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nVolkswagen has ordered dealers to reinforce the fuel pump flanges on affected vehicles with protective&nbsp;butyl rubber film. However, models that exhibit extensive cracking will receive replacement fuel pump flanges of a new, more durable design. This latest recall extension involving the Audi Q7 and Q5 is expected to begin in July, according to Volkswagen. Owners in need of more immediate assistance prior to the official campaign launch date are advised to contact the NHTSA.
