Both create a higher risk of accidents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, out of all the fatal accidents which occur In the United States, about half happen at night. Considering that only about 25% of all driving takes place at night, this means the nighttime fatality rate is about three times as high as the daytime rate. Data also shows that the more poorly lit a road is, the more severe its accidents are.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally, Nissan planned to have dealers replace the faulty headlights, starting October 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, on August 27, 2020 Nissan notified dealers that it was filing a petition arguing that the defect did not warrant a recall because of how minor it is.
