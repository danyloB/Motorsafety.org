According to a Part 573 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, this problem concerns 5,561 e-Golf vehicles, with &#8220;stalling events&#8221; related to this defect traced back to early last year. The power systems in these vehicles could potentially deactivate the battery.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<p>The report further described this as a case of &#8220;<a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM499320/RCLRPT-16V138-8876.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oversensitive battery diagnosis</a>,&#8221; where the system switches off due to a perceived&nbsp;surge. Normally, this feature is a safety precaution, but when there&#8217;s no power surge occurring, the shutdown is a risk for occupants. Though it does occur with a &#8220;high voltage system warning,&#8221; the deactivation can directly impact the vehicle&#8217;s motor.</p>\n<p>Stalling events related to this issue only seem to have affected models on the U.S. market. The source said that dealers will address the problem by adjusting the included battery management software, reflecting a February update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Battery management software will be updated to contain a less sensitive diagnostic routine, which is robust against minor current peaks/surges and does not lead to inadvertent emergency shutdown of the high voltage battery,&#8221; the report added.</p>\n<p>A recent Wall Street Journal article put this action in context with Volkswagen&#8217;s other recalls. In addition to the ongoing attempts to fix vehicles tainted by the emissions cheat scandal, the manufacturer is also dealing with a brake pedal issue in approximately 800,477 cars. These include Porsche Cayennes and Volkswagen Touaregs.</p>\n<p>Because the new action solely concerns electric vehicles, it could undercut the company&#8217;s attempt to focus on this sector instead of the diesel-powered autos, the article added.

However, the manufacturer has another issue on its hands involving non-secured brake pedal pivot pins.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<p>According to a statement from Volkswagen, included in a post on Autoblog, <a href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2016/03/24/vw-touareg-porsche-cayenne-recall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">46,700 Volkswagen Touaregs are included in this action</a>. A similar issue also affected 409,477 North American Porsche Cayenne vehicles, with the majority (88,300) in the United States.</p>\n<p>With both manufacturers, the suspect vehicles could be missing a vital securing clip that will affect braking performance. No accidents in North America have yet been connected to this issue, but eventually the brake pedal itself could be displaced if users and car dealers don&#8217;t take further action.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the clip is missing, the pedal pivot pin could start to move and the pedal could lose guidance,&#8221; the statement read. &#8220;If this remains undiscovered, the pedal hinge could fracture after continued operation, allowing the pedal to dislodge. A customer may not be able to properly actuate the brakes with a dislodged brake pedal.&#8221; Dealers can replace the clip to fix the problem.</p>\n<p>Last year, 91,800 Volkswagen vehicles were involved in a different recall concerning braking issues, as a Part 573 Report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. These vehicles, which included Passat Golf and Beetle models, among others, were potentially subject to &#8220;unexpected, reduced engine power.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This was because of the way camshafts could deteriorate, leading to a greater difficulty in braking. The first reports of camshaft failures related to this recall were detected in February 2015, the report said, and the decision to recall came after several months of analysis, with October 16, 2015 the official &#8220;date of determination.&#8221;Drivers may have noticed an increased effort in braking with this issue.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=6554","createdAt":"2016-04-01T01:57:23.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-04-01T15:42:23.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T11:18:44.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T01:03:44.000Z","display_date":"April 01, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":4,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_1135942532-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1135942532-1","category":{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"}]}]
