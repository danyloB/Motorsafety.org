Both manufacturers have been dealing with multiple fire-related recalls, sometimes for unknown reasons.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Washington, D.C. – January 30, 2022</em> – The U.S. government auto safety regulator is looking into whether Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) and Kia (OTCMKTS:KIMTF) will need to recall additional vehicles that may be prone to catching fire and whether remedies for the recalls both manufacturers have already issued are adequate to lower the risk of fire. Both companies have already issued various recalls for vehicles catching fire, sometimes for unknown reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest development is part of an ongoing probe into the situation that affects an estimated 3 million vehicles. A partial list of the vehicles is below:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2013 Hyundai Elantra</strong></li><li><strong>2012 Hyundai Santa Fe</strong></li><li><strong>2017 Hyundai Tucson</strong></li><li><strong>2013 &#8211; 2014 Santa Fe Sport</strong></li><li><strong>2011 &#8211; 2014 Hyundai Sonata</strong></li><li><strong>2011 &#8211; 2013 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid</strong></li><li><strong>2016 &#8211; 2017 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016 Hyundai Veloster</strong></li><li><strong>2012 &#8211; 2015 Kia Forte</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 21, the regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&nbsp; (NHTSA), opened this probe – called an engineering analysis – on the heels of “161 fires potentially due to engine failures,”&nbsp; which resulted in three injuries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the complaints submitted, 125 were about vehicles that were not previously included in any fire-related recalls, while the rest was about cars that&nbsp; have already been repaired under one of the eight recalls that have so far been issued due to the risk of these vehicles catching fire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=EA21003\" target=\"_blank\">The full list of vehicles being investigated is available here</a>. Hyundai owns 33.8% of Kia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>‘Caught fire while parked and turned off’</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the cars previously not included in a fire-related recall are the ​​2013 Hyundai Elantra, 2011 Kia Sorento and 2012-2015 Kia Rio with as many as 550,000 of them potentially subject to recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of the related complaints, the driver alleges that his or her car caught fire while turned off in a parking lot of a restaurant. Witnesses mentioned hearing “electrical sparks” before the fire. The driver did not have insurance that would cover the loss of his or her “only mode of transportation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another situation, a 2013 Elantra with only “8-12 miles on it” was “fully engulfed” after minutes of catching fire for unknown reasons. A third driver lost his or her brakes but did not receive any additional warnings before seeing smoke coming out from the back of the car while out on the highway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Potential inadequate remedies</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 35 complaints are about cars that received recall repairs, but still ended up having engine issues. The following recalls may need to be “re-done” with a new repair:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-recalls-over-120000-cars-over-faulty-engines-that-may-catch-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">Hyundai recalls over 120,000 cars over faulty engines that may catch fire</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-issues-fifth-recall-over-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">Hyundai issues fifth recall over fire risk</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-motors-recalls-nearly-300000-cars-over-engine-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">Kia Motors recalls nearly 300,000 cars over engine fire risk</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-recalls-vehicles-over-an-engine-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">Kia recalls vehicles over risk of engine fire</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-recalls-vehicles-engine-defect/\" target=\"_blank\">Kia recalls vehicles with engine defect</a>                                                           </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Background of the investigation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyundai and Kia have been under the scrutiny of the U.S. government since 2017 when NHTSA opened queries regarding Theta II engine recalls that contained various “inaccuracies” in the associated reports. Both manufacturers were found liable and paid hefty penalties &#8211; $70 million for Kia and $140 million for Hyundai –<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-recalls-over-120000-cars-over-faulty-engines-that-may-catch-fire/\" target=\"_blank\"> and were required to take a host of safety-related measures to ensure that these omissions would not happen in the future</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation to investigate claims of “non-crash fires,” which resulted in multiple recalls. The investigation has now been upgraded to this engineering analysis, which typically takes a year and may result in additional recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Will your vehicle be part of a new recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No new recalls have been announced as of the publication of this article, but future Hyundai engine recalls and Kia engine recalls may be coming.

Trucks that are part of this recall include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2021 Ford F-250 SD&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Ford F-350 SD&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Ford F-450 SD&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Ford F-550 SD</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Ford F-600 SD</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Ford F-650&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Ford F-750</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All trucks from this list are equipped with a 6.7L diesel engine with a pair of fuel filters, which protect the engine from debris and rust. Due to &#8220;foreign material&#8221; mixed with the material the filter is made from, the affected vehicles’ secondary fuel filter may develop a small crack, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=22V013000\" target=\"_blank\">which may cause a fuel leak under the hood</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The component in question is the secondary diesel fuel filter with part number LC34-9150-AA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuel that is leaking inside the engine compartment can come in contact with hot components, such as an exhaust manifold or turbocharger. Although not flammable as gasoline, diesel fuel can still ignite, causing vehicle fire, which carries several risks. <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mazdaspeed6-and-mazda-rx-8-recalled-over-fuel-leak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">For more on what to do if your car catches fire, please refer to this article about a Mazda recall due to the same risk.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a leak develops, drivers and passengers may notice a strong fuel smell coming from under the hood. In addition, a leak may be severe enough to trigger the “Check Engine” light on the dashboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other&nbsp; Ford recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the Ford F-350 SD trucks from this recall may have been affected by a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-vehicles-for-stalling-during-driving/\" target=\"_blank\">driveshaft issue from September last year</a>.

Front axles in particular also aid with steering and cushioning the blow from driving on uneven roads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An integral carrier, more commonly known as subframe, is the central part of the front axle that holds most of the suspension components in place. The supplier of these parts in the recalled vehicles did not apply enough “corrosion protection,” potentially leading the carrier to corrode and break or bend under loads. <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V990-8582.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">This may cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The component in question is the “Integral Carrier” with part number A1776207101.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing control of the car greatly increases the risk of a crash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Daimler recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among all the previous recalls concerning the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB 250 4matic, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-suvs-for-water-leak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the one from July caused by a water leak is the most recent one</a>.

This recall supersedes and expands the one conducted for the same issue in 2019 and affects the following vehicles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2019 Subaru Ascent&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Subaru Ascent</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Subaru </strong><strong></strong><strong>Legacy</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Subaru Outback</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected vehicles have automatic transmission that operates using hydraulic pressure. Upon startup, it takes a brief moment before this pressure is sufficient to move the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this only takes a second or two, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V955000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">due to a software issue, the clutch of the affected vehicles may engage before adequate pressure within the transmission is achieved.</a> This may result in the drive chain &#8211; which transfers power to the wheels &#8211; slipping and the driver not being able to use the gear selector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long-term, the drive chain may break, which could cause the vehicle to stall while driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The component in question is the Transmission Control Unit, or TCU, with multiple part numbers including&nbsp; 30919AG75A and 30919AH14D.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the transmission malfunctions in traffic, the vehicle will lose its ability to move. That may increase the risk of a crash or injury, especially if it happens in dense traffic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several complaints associated with this recall mention the car “lurching forward and then back,&#8221; sometimes on a multi-lane highway. Another driver describes a harrowing experience of “losing power twice going up the steep hill” and “narrowly avoiding a collision due to slippery road.” </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Subaru recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to this one, there was a recent Subaru Outback recall in August, caused by a possibility of an engine stall. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/subaru-recalls-vehicles-due-to-risk-of-engine-stall/\" target=\"_blank\">The culprit was a faulty fuel pump.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Background of the recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 75,000 2019 Subaru Ascent SUVs that are part of this recall were  previously recalled for the same issue in December 2019. As of July 22, 2021 &#8211; the last date for which information is available &#8211; most of them have been repaired. However, according to the manufacturer, they will need to have the new remedy applied to be safe on the road. See information about the remedy further in this article and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\">use MotorSafety’s free vehicle lookup tool to see if your Subaru is affected.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will fix the issue by updating the TCU software. Additionally, they will conduct appropriate inspections to determine if the transmission has sustained any damage, and replace it if needed. The remedy is expected to be available in April 2022. Notifications about the repair will be sent to vehicle owners by mail on February 7, 2022, and owners who repaired the transmission on their own dime may be eligible for reimbursement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This Subaru Recall 2021 includes almost 200,000 vehicles.

This increases the risk of stall, loss of vehicle control or a rollaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall includes the following pickups:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2021 Ford F-150&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2022 Ford F-150&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall centers around the trucks’ underbody insulation, as well as their driveshafts. The insulation helps dampen road noise and protect the undercarriage from moisture, scratches and salt to extend the useful life of the vehicle. Driveshafts are critical components that transfer power to the wheels, enabling the vehicle to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a supplier error, the insulation may become loose and sag, rubbing against the driveshaft, eventually causing it to fracture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The underbody insulator is the component in question with part numbers ML3B-1611205-AC, ML3B-1611205-BA, ML3B-1611204-AD and ML3B-1611204-BB.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fractured driveshaft <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V986-6742.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">presents a number of concerns—the car may stall or the driver may lose control if the driveshaft snaps and drags on the ground</a>.&nbsp; The vehicle may roll away if the parking brake is not applied. All of these scenarios increase the risk of injury or a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drivers may notice loose underbody insulation (which <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.f150gen14.com/forum/threads/recall-21s56-loose-sagging-underbody-insulators-driveshaft-fracture-hazard.7616/page-6#post-140580\" target=\"_blank\">looks a bit like a foil-covered mat</a>) and hear a rattling, clicking or clunking noise. Looking at the driveshaft, they may be able to see &#8220;marking or scoring&#8221; where the insulation has been touching it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Ford recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is at least the second F-150 recall in the past six months&nbsp;due to driveshaft issues. In June, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-vehicles-that-may-stall-or-roll-away/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford recalled close to 5,000 2021 F-150 trucks due to driveshaft separation that could also cause the vehicle to roll away or stall</a>, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separately, in October, the manufacturer told owners of 2021 F-150 Super Cab pickup trucks <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-tells-owners-not-to-drive-f-150-trucks-with-faulty-seat-belts/\" target=\"_blank\">not to drive their vehicles pending an inspection because of potentially faulty seat belts that may fail to provide adequate protection in the event of a crash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will inspect the driveshaft for damage and “properly attach” the insulators. These services are free. Notifications with more instructions will be sent to owners by mail between January 31 and February 4, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 180,000 trucks are included in this Ford F-150 recall.
