That might lead to an accident, Subaru recalls say.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deformed Impeller Prompts Recall</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2019 Subaru Ascent, Impreza, Legacy, and Outback cars and SUVs</strong><br></li><li><strong>Low pressure fuel pump might stop working.</strong><br></li><li><strong>188,207 vehicles in the U.S. are recalled</strong><br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A bad impeller inside the low-pressure fuel pump could become deformed over time, the <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V218000&amp;refurl=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">NHTSA recall notice</a> says. The deformation could cause the impeller to jam inside the low-pressure fuel pump and disable it. If that happens, the “check engine” warning light or the “malfunction indicator” light on the dash might signal a problem. The Subaru also might run roughly if it does not stall. Restarts might become impossible, which increases the risk of a crash, Subaru of America says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Subaru Specifies Recalled Models</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fuel pump recall does not apply to every car listed above. Subaru says it only applies to the following models when respective owners confirm it in advance. Doing so requires using the “Vehicle Coverage Inquiry” link at Subarunet.com. The number of Subaru recalls in the U.S. and their respective build dates are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>40,950 Ascent SUVs built from June 26, 2018, through Jan. 18, 2019<br></li><li>40,797 Impreza cars built from June 18, 2018, through Feb. 25, 2019<br></li><li>20,198 Subaru Legacy cars built from June 29, 2018, through Feb. 19, 2019<br></li><li>86,278 Subaru Outback cars built from June 29, 2018, through Feb. 19, 2019<br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Subaru says a limited supply of replacement fuel pumps will arrive soon to support the recall. Additional models are recalled in Canada, which pushes the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/fuel-pump-problem-forces-subaru-recall-200k-vehicles-70263441\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">total number recalled</a> to more than 200,000 in North America.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Fuel Pump Fixes the Problem</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Subaru says the replacement fuel pumps will arrive soon in limited quantities. Once the replacement parts start arriving, Subaru will replace the faulty fuel pump with a new one after respective owners confirm the service online. It expects to start replacing the faulty Subaru fuel pumps on June 5. The matter has not caused any reported accidents or injuries, Subaru says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Stalling Problems for Subaru</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Subaru fuel pump problem is the latest to cause stalling problems in recently built Subaru vehicles. Recent Subaru safety issues due to stalling include an <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/nearly-a-half-million-subarus-recalled-due-to-stall-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">October 2019 recall</a> that addressed faulty engine control modules in up to 500,000 Impreza and Crosstrek made from 2017 to 2019. The carmaker also recently <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/another-recall-ordered-for-subaru-impreza-and-crosstrek-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\">recalled certain 2019 Crosstrek, Ascent, and Forester SUVs</a> due to a stalling problem. A faulty PCV valve could separate and cause motor oil and valve pieces to enter the engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does This Recall Affect You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To determine whether the Subaru fuel pump problem affects your vehicle,  it is not enough to just know the make, model and year.

The Remote control of these vehicles may allow the vehicle to move without control.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Laguna Hills, CA – April 9, 2020 – </em>Hyundai Motor America (Hyundai) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCAK-20V213-7991.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a recall of 2020 Nexo and Sonata vehicles. 11,870 vehicles are included in the recall. The issue is with self-parking system recently popularized by a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85iRQdjCzj0\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube video featuring A-list celebrities</a>. The remote control of these vehicles may allow the vehicle to move without control and cause a crash, exposing owners and others to injury. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Parking System Malfunction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Smart Park&#8221; remote parking control problem of Hyundai’s Sonata and Nexo 2020 vehicles was seen in February 2020 when the company was testing these vehicles. It then did a software update to correct the problem on vehicles it built after but did not update vehicles already built. The issue was seen as rare and not likely to happen again. A Hyundai spokesman told <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hyundai/sonata/2020/road-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Consumer Report</a> that more investigation had to be done to see if a recall is needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyundai later got a report that a vehicle continued to move without control while parking remotely. That vehicle was one built before the software update. The company said no one was injured in that incident and it is not aware of any similar incident in the USA. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem only affects 2020 Sonata vehicles made between Oct. 22, 2019, and March 20 and Nexo vehicles rolled out between Aug. 16, 2019, and Feb. 18, 2020. The company says there has been <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V213-5106.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">no report of accident, injury, or death</a> due to the problem. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyundai did have some recalls over the years involving some of its vehicles. The problems were with Sonata, Genesis, Santa Fe and Tucson. Issues included hood latch not securing properly, brake light indicator not coming on, transmission problem causing vehicle to stall, and sunroof deflector detaching while driving. None of the issues present a lethal risk. Recall <a href=\"https://www.kbb.com/hyundai/recall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">completion</a> rate for these issues is at 86.5%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest remote-control problem is not widespread, confined only to the 2020 Sonata and Nexo vehicles made before the problem was seen. There is no other open recall for this vehicle part, as the system was only installed on early output of these two models. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does This Hyundai Recall Affect You?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyundai will notify owners, and dealers will update the software free of charge. The recall is expected to begin June 4, 2020.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">motorsafety.org</a> lookup tool to find out if your vehicle is affected, book an appointment for a free repair, and sign up for notifications. </p>\n<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script>","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17885","createdAt":"2020-04-09T10:27:13.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-04-10T00:12:13.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-07T23:43:38.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-08T13:28:38.000Z","display_date":"April 09, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":23,"name":"Joe Glaser","slug":"joeglaser"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"20V213000","recall_date":"April 9, 2020"},"year":2020,"month":4,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1045318702-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1045318702","category":{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1005,"name":"2020 Hyundai Nexo recall","slug":"2020-hyundai-nexo-recall"},{"id":1006,"name":"2020 Hyundai Sonata recall","slug":"2020-hyundai-sonata-recall"},{"id":1008,"name":"Hyundai remote control issue","slug":"hyundai-remote-control-issue"},{"id":1007,"name":"Hyundai self parking recall","slug":"hyundai-self-parking-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"}]}]
