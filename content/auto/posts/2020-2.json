The low pressure hose connects the low pressure fuel pump to the direct injection fuel pump. If the low pressure hose cracks, fuel may leak from the hose and cause fire. A slight fuel smell may develop if the fuel hose starts to leak, if vehicle occupants start to smell fuel they are advised to stop operation of the vehicle immediately and have the vehicle inspected. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2016, Hyundai Motor America (HMA) decided to conduct and investigation into previous reports concerning a fuel leak in certain model year 2013 Sonata vehicles. Of the previously recorded incidents, none of them indicated engine fire, smoke, or any time of burning odor. Hyundai decided to issue a Quality Information Report (“QIR”) and open an examination into the potential for the leak to cause an engine compartment fire. From December 2016 to April 2017, Hyundai continued to investigate the previously reported incidents as well as new field reports. The new incidents were similar to previously recorded ones &#8211; a fuel leak without any evidence of an engine compartment fire. In May 2017, HMA finalized their investigation and decided that the fuel leak in the low pressure fuel hose was too small to ignite a engine compartment fire. Formally closing the investigation, HMA decided to continually motor field reports from vehicle owners. In February 2020, HMA received news from Kia Motors America that they were to recall certain vehicles that were made with the same fuel pumps as the previously examined Sonata vehicles. Kia Motors America issued a safety recall in the U.S. on certain vehicles whose low pressure fuel lead line may creak and leak fuel, increasing the risk of an engine compartment fire. Although, HMA received no reports of a engine compartment fire in their vehicles, they decided on February 25, 2020 to issue a formal safety recall on 2013-2014 Sonata vehicles with cracked fuel pumps.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current remedy to this recall is under investigation. Most likely it will entail a patch to the crack in the lead to the fuel pump or the installation of a completely new fuel pump, but information provided by HMA is limited. Once the remedy has been decided upon, it will be performed at no charge.

Owners of affected truck’s installed with the recalled Daytime Running Lamps (DRL) could possibly impair the vision of other drivers if not aware of the defect. The Daytime Running Lamps were noticed to not properly dim to parking lamps when the Master Lighting Switch (MLS) has been switched from the default setting (Autolamps) to the setting “Headlamps On”. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attention was brought to the possible recall by a customer&#8217;s observation. In October 2019, the owner of a Ford F-150 truck observed that certain DRL capabilities were exhibited unexpectedly (not properly turning on/off or dimming). Ford’s Critical Concerns Review Group (CCRG) decided to consult the vehicle owner’s claims for an overview of possible product malfunction. CCRG observed that in assembly of 2018-2020 F-150 headlamps created the possibility of DRL to not properly dim and therefore not be in compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, “Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment.” The headlamps, when the Master Lighting Switch was rotated from “Autolamp” to “headlamps on”, would cause the LED lamps to remain at full brightness even though they should have automatically dimmed. On February, 14, 2020, Ford’s Field Review Committee decided to approve field action to bring awareness to the issue. Ford has released a statement claiming no reports or knowledge of injury relating to this issue. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected vehicle owners will receive a notification letter from Ford on March 9, 2020 outline the details of how to fix their vehicles issue. Owners will be asked to bring in their vehicle to any official Ford or Lincoln dealership to have the Body Control Module (BCM) configuration update so as to ensure the issue will cease. All owners will be reimbursed for this repair.

The first incidents cited of loose third brake lamp assemblies came in July, 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BMW decided to issue an engineering review and field data analysis in August, suggesting the possible cause could be local weather due to the close proximity and dates of each of the incidents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the M6 Gran Coupe was no longer in production, a specific review of the production process could not be performed, but the problem was expected to lie in the unique carbon fiber roof, a specific feature of the M6 Gran Coupe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The months of September through November were spent assembling parts and vehicles for testing. Once the parts were assembled multiple tests were performed which consisted of long term environmental exposure to the carbon roof to determine its interaction with the third brake lamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, the tests were deemed inconclusive and environmental ware on the brake lamp fasteners and carbon roof were ruled out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2020, an additional series of tests were performed to determine the effect of loose and missing fasteners on the attachment of the third brake lamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late January, BMW noted that prior to the official testing of the M6 Gran Coupe, fasteners for the third brake lamp were already loose. On January 31, tests concluded that the separation of the third brake lamp from the vehicle was due to missing or loose fasteners not environmental conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 12, 2020 BMW decided to release an official recall, citing the test results.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All 2014 &#8211; 2019 M6 Gran Coupe vehicle owners will receive a letter in April from BMW of North America, LLC citing the official recall. Vehicle users may still operate the vehicle if the third brake light becomes detached but are strongly advised not to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, BMW asks that all affected vehicle owners schedule an appointment at any authorized BMW center to perform the proper repair, free of charge. The repair of the detached brake light, new fasteners will be installed to secure the brake lamp into place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This repair will take approximately one hour to complete. Owners wishing to have their vehicle serviced are advised to wait until they receive the official letter from BMW, so as to ensure the necessary tools, parts and procedures are available. In the meantime owners are free to schedule an appointment at any authorized BMW center. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check your car’s recall status using MotorSafety’s <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">free vehicle lookup tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#00649e;font-size:12px\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>About MotorSafety.org</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">MotorSafety.org is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to vehicle safety and assisting consumers with the identification and resolution of vehicle manufacturing recalls and defects.

Some vehicles are at a higher exploding risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These include <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/honda-airbag-inflators-may-explode-unexpectedly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Honda and Acura vehicles from 1996 to 2000</a>. In March 2019, the driver of a 2002 Honda Civic died in the hospital following a crash that initiated the rupturing of the airbag and injured the driver.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deaths and injuries worldwide<strong><br></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is suspected that <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/takata-airbag-recall-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Takata inflators have caused about 25 deaths and 300 injuries</a> throughout the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the United States, more than 50 million Takata inflators are in recall status, resulting in the most vehicle recalls in the country’s history. The problem has been so big and impactful that it forced the airbag company into bankruptcy.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When can owners expect notification?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 21, 2019, German car manufacturer Volkswagen, Audi&#8217;s parent company, received reports from suppliers about issues with NADI inflators found during field tests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audi&#8217;s safety board was notified a few weeks later in November, and talks with the supplier commenced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After confirming the risk, Audi notified the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the risk and the findings of their investigation so far, and Audi began an analysis of retrieved parts from the German and international markets in early January 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneously, Takata sent out a defect report detailing the issues with the NADI inflators and the danger they posed. Audi independently verified the risk on January 22, 2020, when their own test results showed that there was indeed a risk of slow or no airbag deployment. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Repair</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen is recalling all vehicles that have the faulty airbag to prevent the owners and occupants of their vehicles from harm. Replacement parts are not yet available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recall documents, Volkswagen told NHTSA, &#8220;At this point, due to the age of the vehicles, a repair is not available. Audi is working intensively on a remedy with the supplier, but currently it is unclear when the remedy will be available.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When can owners expect notification?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This round of Audi recalls started March 27, 2020. Those affected by the recall should have been notified or will be soon. Audi owners will receive a second notification when the parts are available. In some cases, both the driver’s airbag and the passenger front airbags are at risk.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Volkswagen wasn’t the first to issue a recall</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BMW recalled 357,000 older automobiles back in January. This recall includes an estimated 293,000 BMW 3-Series from the year 2000 to 2006 as well as approximately 60,000 3 Series and 1 Series BMWs from 2006 to 2012. Some of the automaker’s SUVs were also equipped with the faulty airbags.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 107,000 cars are part of this Audi recall.&nbsp; As of March 29, 2021, repairs were still not available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check back on the repair status, bookmark MotorSafety’s<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"> free lookup tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Note: June 8, 2021</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We have noticed a large number of readers are interested in this recall.

These vehicles are equipped with six-speed automatic (68RFE) transmissions that are susceptible to wear and tear from thermal loading. Heat can cause transmission fluid to leak from the dipstick tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential number of units affected is estimated at 84,202.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The defect<br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected vehicles are equipped with defective transmission assemblies that are prone to being damaged due to thermal stressors. Chrysler has not specified what specific aspect of the transmission or vehicle itself makes this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A build-up of heat and pressure inside of the transmission can cause transmission fluid to be expelled from the dipstick tube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transmission fluid is flammable, and this loose liquid can come in contact with other ignition sources, such as the turbocharger, and start a fire in the engine compartment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The possibility of fire increases the risk of injury and death on part of the operators and also can result in costly damage to the vehicle&#8217;s internals. In addition, sufficient amounts of transmission fluid can damage mechanical or electronic components even if no fire is started. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This defect is known to have resulted in engine compartment fires several times, and one minor injury was recorded, according to Chrysler. No warranty claims have been made in relation to this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeline of events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 4, 2019, Chrysler&#8217;s US Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance (VSRC) group opened an investigation following reports of 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks suffering from engine compartment fires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Believing a defective part was responsible, VRSC analyzed fire patterns, damaged components, witness statements and other aspects of each event in order to determine trends related to these incidents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrysler engineering soon conducted their own tests to duplicate the issue as it was reported in the field, and on January 9, 2020, engineers believed they had found the root cause of the issue: the transmission in these vehicles was being overloaded due to temperature and pressure changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon receiving these test results, Chrysler manufacturing plants conducted a review of records to determine the size of the recall population. It was determined that only the transmissions in 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks were susceptible to leaking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the risk confirmed and the size of the recall population determined, Chrysler began planning a process for the voluntary recall and replacement of parts, and on January 24, 2020, they submitted a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V043-1077.PDF\">notice of recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 3, 2020, this notice of recall became public.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrysler will notify owners of 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks of the recall and the danger associated with leaking transmission lines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company will soon ship out replacement parts to authorized dealers and train them in the remedy process, which involves reprogramming the powertrain control system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the remedy process is available, dealers will replace the transmission valve body separator plates and reprogram the control module, free of charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a voluntary recall, however, owners of the affected units are advised to exercise caution when operating their vehicles. The recall is expected to begin on March 14, 2020. This date is subject to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">MotorSafety.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#00649e;font-size:12px\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>About MotorSafety.org</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">MotorSafety.org is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to vehicle safety and assisting consumers with the identification and resolution of vehicle manufacturing recalls and defects.

Mazda’s LED DRL are installed to ensure an increased visibility of the vehicle&#8217;s exterior during the daytime. If the DRL fails to turn on, the vehicles exterior may be reduced to other motorists and could result in a possible crash or injury.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected LED headlight units were first documented in March 2015 when certain headlight units, installed for vehicles in the Japan market, did not properly illuminated during the testing process. This issue was due to increased damage to the LED circuit by residual static electricity sustained during certain parts of the manufacturing process. Mazda ensured that the issue did not frequently occur but continued to monitor for field occurrences and installed the LED circuit with static electricity resistance properties. Although the improved LED headlight was installed on the vehicles manufactured in Japan, U.S. CX-5 models were not installed with the new headlight. By April 2015, Mazda received reports of U.S. CX-5 models experiencing similar issues as those vehicles which were manufactured in Japan. After an investigation of returned parts in July, 2015, Mazda found similar breaking in the LED circuit as those found in the previous manufacturing process. New LED low sulfur black gasket replaced the previous LED connector sealing gasket, improving a simple aesthetic issue in the headlight locale. In March 2016, Mazda received evidence of two field reports of headlight malfunction outside of Japan. The affected vehicles were manufactured before the LED circuit improvement made during the manufacturing process in March 2015. In September, 2018, Mazda continued to experience similar failures on improved parts and decided to investigate other possible causes of headlight malfunction. In January, 2019, after an extensive investigation, Mazda found the issue to be damage to the LED circuit caused by silver sulfide. The close proximity of the LED circuit to a gray type sealing gasket (a high sulfur gasket attached to the DRL connector) could transfer sulfur to the LED circuit, resulting in malfunction of the DRL. January, 2020, Mazda decided to introduce an official recall to certain MY2016 CX-5 vehicles following pressure from field action in the Japan market. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mazda will notify owners on&nbsp; March 6, 2020 of their vehicle’s official recall. Authorized Mazda dealerships will inspect the LED circuit headlights and, if necessary, replace the gasket or headlight assembly, free of charge. Affected vehicle owners may contact Mazda customer service with the recall number 4320A at 1-800-222-5500 for more information. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">MotorSafety.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#00649e;font-size:12px\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>About MotorSafety.org</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">MotorSafety.org is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to vehicle safety and assisting consumers with the identification and resolution of vehicle manufacturing recalls and defects.

Affected vehicles&#8217; rearview cameras may have a delay between their display and actual events because of a software problem. As a result, these vehicles are not in compliance with Federal Motor Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, &#8220;Rearview Mirrors.&#8221;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Defect</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected vehicles&#8217; rearview cameras may have an insufficient response time. A delayed image might mean that drivers miss hazards that are behind them, increasing the possibility of an accident.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This defect only occurs in certain situations. Specifically, the vehicle&#8217;s central display must be manually turned off before the ignition is turned off, and the gear selector must be shifted into reverse within 25 seconds of the car subsequently restarting. Aside from that, however, the driver will have no warning signs that their rearview camera is not working at full capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercedes Benz began to review rearview backup camera performance on some of its vehicles in Aug 2018. This internal review came as a result of specific information and Mercedes Benz&#8217;s line of vans. However, reviewers determined that the issue affecting Mercedes&#8217; vans might also be occurring on the rearview cameras of some passenger cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Oct 2018, Mercedes Benz began incorporating an updated rearview camera software into its vehicles, as well as already manufactured vehicles that were still in production facilities or vehicle preparation centers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer of 2019, a task force set up by Mercedes Benz America began conducting a review of open plant actions. During that review, officials became aware of the possibility that some of the updated vehicles may have been reworked in ways that did not meet specifications exactly, causing the defect and putting the vehicles out of compliance with Federal Motor Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, &#8220;Rearview Mirrors.&#8221; Task force workers informed the Mercedes Benz after sales department. Further analysis determined the range of affected vehicles as being at only 22 vehicles sold in the United States. At the time of the recall, no reports of delay or associated accidents have been reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Jan 17, 2020, Mercedes Benz America decided to conduct a safety recall.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected owners can take their vehicles into a certified Mercedes Benz dealer to have the software of their rearview camera updated. Dealers will be notified of the pending recall on Feb 3, 2020. Owners of recalled vehicles will be notified on March 27, 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercedes Benz will be required to send a draft of their planned owner notification letters to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at least five days prior to mailing. In addition, the company must submit copies of any additional communications with owners and dealers, including notices and bulletins, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days of their publication. Finally, Mercedes Benz must submit six quarterly reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration moving forward</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defect in rearview camera technology was fixed in production from Oct 2018 forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers that sell any recalled vehicles in their inventory previous to repair are in violation of federal law.

Electrical shorts within the affected ABS Modules’ may result in engine fires, even when the car is not being used. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The estimated total of affected vehicles is 429,686 <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The defect</strong><br></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 400,000 Hyundai vehicles from 2006-2011 are under recall due to a risk of electrical shortage and increased risk of engine combustion. Hyundai Motor America received their first claim of an alleged engine fire on a 2007 Hyundai Elantra in October 2017. Hyundai Motors immediately requested all field information that could possibly related to other incidents of internal engine combustion and found two additional reports of internal fires in Elantra vehicles. On all three vehicles various fuses related to the Anti-lock Brake (ABS) Module were found open, indicating the possible origin of the three internal shorts and engine combustion. After two of the three known incident parts were received in November 2017, Hyundai Motors analyzed the recovered parts for signs of internal shorting due to exposed brake fluid or moisture contamination. By March 2018, Hyundai Motors could not properly confirm that internal shorting was caused by moisture ingress due to the extent of heat damage to the incident ABS Modules. In the remaining months of 2018, Hyundai continued to motor incidents in the field but&nbsp; was made aware of only one additional incident and decided to initiate a recovery of in-use ABS modules for random inspection.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By March 2019, a total of eleven new vehicles were surveyed (one new incident vehicle and ten previously in-use vehicles) but no sign of moisture ingress was apparent. From April 2019 to December 2019, Hyundai Motors continued their analysis in warranty part returns from both U.S. markets and international markets, hoping to find evidence of possible moisture interference. In this analysis Hyundai found certain recovery parts conditions that could potentially lead to increased moisture in the electrical circuit of ABS modules. Although no certain trend relating to Elantra design or manufacturing, Hyundai recommended addressing the issue by de-powering the ABS module during the ignition OFF state but ultimately decided to conduct an official safety recall on January 28, 2020.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Hyundai is still looking for premature signs of moisture ingress in ABS Modules, the proper solution at the moment is to install a relay in the vehicle’s main junction box to ensure little to no risk of an ABS short-circuit. Any official Hyundai dealer will perform this recall repair free of charge. Owners will be notified by Hyundai Motor America on the official expected recall date &#8211; April 3, 2020. Until then, affected owners may contact Hyundai customer service at 1-855-371-9460 with the official recall number, 188, for more information.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">MotorSafety.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#00649e;font-size:12px\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>About MotorSafety.org</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">MotorSafety.org is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to vehicle safety and assisting consumers with the identification and resolution of vehicle manufacturing recalls and defects.
