Kia first addressed it by<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V100000\" target=\"_blank\"> inspecting the suspected fuel line and replacing those that already developed cracks</a>.

In addition, the vehicle may display a malfunction indicator light (MIL) on the dashboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Kia Optima recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 440,000 of 2013-2015 Kia Optimas were recalled in June of last year, also due to the possibility of these cars catching fire because of brake fluid leaking into the cars&#8217; anti-lock brakes (ABS), as reported. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/category/kia-recalls/\" target=\"_blank\">For more fire-related Kia recalls, please visit this page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will fix this issue by replacing the low-pressure fuel hose with the updated one.

This increases the risk of a crash and injury.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This investigation may result in a recall, which may affect an estimated 416,000 vehicles, including:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2021 &#8211; 2022 Tesla Model 3</strong></li><li><strong>2021 &#8211; 2022 Tesla Model Y</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Investigation summary </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), opened an investigation on February 16, following 354 complaints about <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=PE22002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">phantom braking occurring when the vehicle was driving using the autopilot feature</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the complaints, vehicles would sometimes start braking &#8220;very aggresively&#8221;, although there were no obstacles on the road. This happened without any prior warnings or apparent reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The autopilot&nbsp; – which is referred to as the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) – allows the vehicle to “ brake and steer automatically within its lanes.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A vehicle that slams on the brakes hard and unexpectedly may be hit from behind by oncoming traffic. In addition, a vehicles’ sudden reaction may confuse the driver and cause it to subsequently lose control over the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Tesla recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this ongoing investigation, there were several recent Tesla Model 3 recalls, including one caused by <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/tesla-recalls-vehicles-that-may-fail-to-warn-pedestrians-of-their-approach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">failure to warn the pedestrians about its approach</a>.

The manufacturer of the vehicles, General Motors (NYSE:GM), has already recalled all of the affected vehicles, as well as 2021-2022 model-years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Investigation conclusion </strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>General Motors conducted three recalls to address the reports of fires. Because of this,&nbsp;the regulator concluded in February 2022 that there was no need for additional recalls and closed the investigations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The first recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After receiving two complaints from owners and several field reports, the government auto safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) initiated the investigation in October 2020. According to these complaints, a fire would develop inside the passenger cabin, underneath the seats, when the vehicle was parked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GM was also aware of the incidents and started investigating to discover what was causing them. Based on initial findings, GM concluded fires were caused by an overheating high-voltage battery, which is located under the seat. The fires would happen when the vehicles were charged to “full or nearly full capacity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manufacturer initially addressed the problem by recalling over 50,000 of the 2017-2019 model-years in November 2020 and reprogramming in a way <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V701000\">so its high-voltage battery would only charge up to 90% of its capacity</a>.&nbsp; Later on in the recall, dealers ran diagnostics tests on the batteries to see if they needed replacing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Subsequent recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As this recall was underway, both General Motors and LG, the battery producer, analyzed the data that dealers collected with the tests. They concluded that the repair offered under the last recall was insufficient and that more batteries needed to be replaced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That prompted <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V-560\">GM to recall all the cars included in the previous recall, as well as additional 2017-2019 model-years in July 2021</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By further analyzing the field data that was coming in from the dealers during the second recall, it eventually became apparent that there were more defective batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-issues-third-chevrolet-bolt-recall-following-car-fires/\">General Motors finally recalled all of 2019-2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV vehicles to replace their high voltage batteries</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Chevrolet recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these Chevy Bolt fire issues mentioned in the summary, there were no other recent Chevy Bolt recalls. Still, other manufacturers have also faced issues with fires caused by high-voltage batteries. One such example is BMW, which had to recall some of its <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-hybrids-recalled-for-contaminated-battery-fire-risk/#:~:text=Risks,themselves\">hybrid vehicles back in September 2020 over a similar problem</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of a recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This Chevy Bolt battery ire investigation did not result in any new recalls, but your car may need repairs for a different issue.

This works together with a visual seat belt reminder that can be seen on the vehicle’s dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the chime is interrupted when the vehicle was previously used while the seat belt was not fastened, a software error will prevent the chime from sounding off the next time the vehicle is used.&nbsp; This will happen if, for example, the driver left the vehicle while the chime was still going off with the engine running and then returned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drivers may not fasten their seat belts, which augments the risk of an injury in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the chime will go off at speeds over 13.7 miles per hour (mph), this may not give the driver enough time to fasten the belt before an accident occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Tesla recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest Tesla seat belt recall is the electric vehicle maker’s fourth, barely two months into 2022.

The finding follows a U.S government investigation which looked into reports of headlight failures with the goal of identifying a safety-related problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Investigation summary </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After receiving over 1,300 complaints from owners of these vehicles,  the regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), initiated the investigation in June 2020.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=PE20008\" target=\"_blank\">According to the complaints, headlights on the SUVs would shut down on their own, without any apparent reason</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Investigation conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon closer examination, the regulator has discovered that headlight issues in question are caused by a connector that may overheat. When that happens, the low beam light may start flickering or even shut down completely. In most cases, this issue was limited to one headlight. And even if both low-beam headlights would shut down, the driver was still able to turn them back on by toggling the headlight switch to the “ON” position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Kia has started replacing these connectors in 2019 as a part of extended warranty,  the regulator concluded last month that there was no need for a recall. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Kia recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the complaints and corresponding investigation, there is no Kia headlights recall or Kia Optima headlight recalls caused by this particular issue.

Much like this recall, this increased the risk of a crash or injury because of reduced visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To remedy the issue, Chrysler will torque the loose wiper nut, at no cost to the car owner.
