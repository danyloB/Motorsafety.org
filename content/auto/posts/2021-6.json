Follow these steps to find out if your car has a safety defect.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Pleasanton, CA – June 16,&nbsp; 2021</em> – When recalls affect brand new cars, car manufacturers are required to have the vehicles repaired before selling them to customers. Efforts must also be made to contact owners after cars leave dealers’ lots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, due to legal loopholes and loose regulations, in some states used car dealers can sell cars without fixing recalls first, and used car owners might not be informed when their car has been recalled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few things you can do to learn about any safety defects your used car has to protect your health and well-being&nbsp; and that of your loved ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. When you are buying, search for open recalls using the car’s VIN</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a tool like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.motorsafety.org\" target=\"_blank\">Motorsafety.org’s recall lookup</a> and plug in your vehicle identification number (VIN)&nbsp; to find out if your car has any recalls that need fixing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find your VIN, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/167203690\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check out this resource</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Update your registration</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto manufacturers use the contact information listed in vehicle registrations at the DMV to track down the current owners of a vehicle under recall. Make sure the address listed on your vehicle’s registration is current so that recall notices will be mailed to your address.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Register directly with the manufacturer</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many manufacturers have an “owners” page on their website that allows owners to register their vehicle with them even if they bought it used. (For example, <a href=\"https://www.toyota.com/owners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this is Toyota’s page</a>.) They can use your registration information to contact you if your car is ever recalled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 54 million vehicles were recalled in the U.S. last year and more recalls are issued every week.

Besides increasing the risk of collision and posing a threat to other drivers, it may not be possible to stop and evacuate the vehicle in time, which may result in injury or death. There is also a risk of property damage, as the burning vehicle may damage surrounding structures and vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the vehicle is repaired, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-recalls-cadenza-and-sportage-over-engine-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it is important to park it outside, away from other vehicles and structures.</a> This will prevent additional property damage in the event of fire when the vehicle is stationary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-hybrids-recalled-for-contaminated-battery-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">In case a fire breaks out while driving, the driver and all occupants should follow these steps to get themselves to safety quickly</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other 2015 Kia Optima recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this recall, the 2015 Kia Optima and 2015 Kia Sorento were among the cars recalled in December 2018 due to fire risk because of a fuel leak.

The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2020 Nissan Armada</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Nissan Armada</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Infiniti QX80</strong></li><li><strong>2021</strong> <strong>Infiniti QX80</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall only includes units equipped with V8 engines. The affected part is the fuel pump module; part number A7040-3ZD0B.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall stems from an<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/honda-recalls-over-600000-cars-that-may-stall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> issue with the impeller</a>, which is a disc that draws fuel from the tank and directs it to the fuel pump. As a result of a supplier error, the impeller can swell and cause the fuel pump to “bind internally.”&nbsp; This can disrupt the flow of fuel to the engine and result in the car stalling while driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been no incidents caused by this issue in the U.S., according to Nissan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fuel pump failure while driving will cause a vehicle to abruptly lose power, increasing the likelihood of being rear-ended by another vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the system fails while the vehicle is immobile, it can prevent the engine from starting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs and safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The manufacturer says there are no warnings before a stall. However, generally speaking,&nbsp;a faulty fuel pump can manifest in a number of ways, such as the engine sputtering at high speeds or a drop in the gas mileage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “check engine” light may also come on. In case you experience any of the above signs while driving, calmly maneuver your car to the side of the road and contact roadside assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Nissan and Infiniti recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in April, Nissan issued a <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/nissan-recalls-infiniti-sedans-at-risk-of-stalling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recall for the 2021 Infiniti Q50 and Q60 sedans</a> that also faced a potential stalling problem. However, that was related to a software issue and bears no connection to this recall. The Nissan Armada 2021 is not subject to any other recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will replace the affected fuel pump module, free of charge. Owners will be sent a letter with more information on July 20. However, it is not clear when the repairs will be performed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 24,000 Nissan vehicles have been affected by this Nissan recall.

The agency is currently conducting engineering analysis, a stage of the investigation process that may result in a recall.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a recall is initiated, any necessary repairs will be free for drivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Terrifying driver experiences</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drivers have been narrating their personal experiences related to this issue since at least 2018. According to one complaint, a driver “collided with the guard wall” after being unable to control the car, which veered “in and out of lanes sharply” on its volition. The driver suffered physical injuries and continues to be haunted by the accident. “Worst of all,” <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/complaints/11306112/11306112-BC8CA19041EAF8ADE05375E87898EC04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the complaint letter stated, “I suffer from nightmares and I have difficulty sleeping.</a>”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another person observed the steering wheel turning “really fast on its own to the left” when they let go of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Crashes and injuries</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to NHTSA, the “phantom steering wheel” has so far led to at least two crashes and several injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Previous investigation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in November 2014, NHTSA led a separate investigation of the 2013 Honda Accord over reports of power steering failure, with <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=10515618,%2010515696,%2010537336,%2010542360,%2010545177,%2010563724,%2010588425,%2010595068,%2010605909,%2010627926,%2010629629,%2010630852,%2010644762,%2010654768,%2010661240,%2010664234,%2010667364,%2010672452,%2010676256,%20%2010695191\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">some reports</a> also describing the steering wheel jerking left or right, veering off-course.
