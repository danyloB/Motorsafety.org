More recently, the organization has sought out possible applicants to work as a monitor as described in a&nbsp;Consent Order and Coordinated Remedy Order.</p>\n<p>Though the recalls have affected 12 manufacturers, including Toyota, Ford and Nissan, the brand with the largest amount of models at high risk is Honda, which claims to have fixed 44 percent of its recalled vehicle population.</p>\n<p>Honda vehicles have also been involved in the accidents the faulty inflators have caused. Most recently, a Utah woman named Randi Johnson sued the company for an explosion that damaged her vocal cords this September. This incident involved a 2003 Honda Civic: Honda reportedly has nine models at the highest levels of risk, dating back as far as model year 2001. There have been eight fatal accidents traced to these inflators so far.</p>\n<p>Late last month, the New York Times reported on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/business/honda-to-recall-300000-accords-for-airbag-problem.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a different Honda recall</a> centered on hundreds of thousands of Accords. Improper sensors in these vehicles could activate airbags if doors were slammed too hard: complaints surrounding this issue reportedly stretch as far back as last year.</p>\n<p>After Honda, the manufacturer with the highest number of affected models is Fiat Chrysler, responsible for seven models at the highest level of risk.

Nearly 256,460 Soul vehicles are part of this new voluntary recall action, affecting those vehicles with model years between 2014 and 2016, according to Car and Driver. In these autos, weak adhesive can cause gears within the steering assemblies to separate.</p>\n<p>Drivers who experienced this failure would have more difficulty steering their vehicles, putting them and passengers at risk. The remedy, listed on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), will require owners and dealers to replace the pinion plug and add a set gear if necessary.</p>\n<p>The decision to launch this recall began on October 29, and the order will officially take place on December 22. Kia initially evaluated the steering gear assembly in&nbsp;2015MY Soul vehicles this September, with the analysis itself being conducted between October 12 and 21.</p>\n<p>During this time, Kia discovered &#8220;that a thread locking adhesive of insufficient bonding strength had been applied&#8221; within the assembly.
