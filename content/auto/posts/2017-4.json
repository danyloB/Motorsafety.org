The recall affects Volkswagen CC four-door models produced between November 2015 and June 2016. The automaker estimates 100 percent of the models named in the campaign include the problematic part.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nThe affected models include head restraints that do not comport with U.S. vehicle safety codes, specifically Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards section 202a, which states that head restraints should meet certain design and <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2012-title49-vol6-sec571-202a.pdf\">performance qualifications</a>, according to the Department of Transportation. The assemblies installed in these vehicles do not comply with these regulations and were instead made for use with Volkswagen vehicles that would be&nbsp;sold in foreign markets. Most notably, the installed head restraints allow occupants to rotate more than 12 degrees while seated, a range of motion deemed unsafe in the FMVSS.</p>\n<p>While the head restraints pose no immediate danger to drivers or passengers, they do lead to an increased risk&nbsp;of&nbsp;injury in the event of an accident. However, Volkswagen has yet to receive in reports of injuries connected to these fixtures.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nVolkswagen engineers first detected the incorrectly installed&nbsp;head restraints in May of last year. Roughly one month later, quality control personnel reported the problem to technical teams and initiated an internal review. Over the course of these investigations, the manufacturer&#8217;s employees learned that the head restraints destined for international models had been installed on American CC sedans, due to a stocking issue. Assembly crew members at one of Volkswagen&#8217;s primary U.S. production&nbsp;facilities had mistakenly brought head restraint assemblies marked &#8220;RoW&#8221; &#8211; an acronym meaning &#8220;rest of world&#8221; &#8211; to the shop floor, where they were installed.</p>\n<p>In early April, engineers met with the Volkswagen Product Safety Committee to determine the extent of the error. Weeks later, these two parties met once more and determined that American CC models equipped with RoW head restraints should be subject to recall.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nVolkswagen has ordered dealers to replace the head restraints, free of charge. The campaign is scheduled to begin in June. The automaker has agreed to notify dealers and owners after the official launch date. Individuals who require assistance prior to the recall are encouraged to contact the NHTSA.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10978","createdAt":"2017-04-28T14:32:57.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-04-29T04:17:57.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T02:45:52.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T16:30:52.000Z","display_date":"April 28, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":4,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_495148735-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_495148735-1","category":{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"}]},{"id":3030,"title":"Toyota Recalls 228,000 New Tacoma Pickups [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/toyota-recalls-228000-new-tacoma-pickups-video/","status":"publish","slug":"toyota-recalls-228000-new-tacoma-pickups-video","excerpt":"<p>April 28, 2017 report from Wotchit News</p>\n","description":"<h5 class=\"yt watch-title-container\">April 28, 2017 report from <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcFaF8UCOsg\" target=\"_blank\">Wotchit News</a></em></h5>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper feature-video\"><iframe width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcFaF8UCOsg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://www.motorsafety.org/?p=3030","createdAt":"2017-04-28T13:01:45.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-04-29T02:46:45.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-04-02T06:07:49.000Z","modified_gmt":"2018-04-02T19:52:49.000Z","display_date":"April 28, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":null,"nhtsa_campaign_number":null,"recall_date":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null,"custom_schema":null},"year":2017,"month":4,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms-1.png","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"toyota_ms-1","category":{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"}]},{"id":10836,"title":"Kia recalls vehicles for engine wear problems [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-recalls-vehicles-engine-wear-problems-video-2/","status":"publish","slug":"kia-recalls-vehicles-engine-wear-problems-video-2","excerpt":"<p>The engines in some Kia vehicles could have debris in them that puts operators at risk.</p>\n","description":"<p>The engines in some Kia vehicles could have debris in them that puts operators at risk.

The campaign affects Versa sedans produced between Feb. 16 and Feb. 21, 2017, as well as Versa Note hatchbacks that rolled off the line over the same span. The automaker has yet to determine what percentage of listed models contain these defective air bags.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nAffected vehicles are equipped with faulty air bag cushion housings. Specifically, the ringed plates that hold the cushioning in place are made of metal with low carbon content. These fixtures are therefore prone to failure in high temperatures and can even separate from the cushioning when safety features are deployed during accidents. When airborne&nbsp;at high speeds, the air bag housing assembly poses great risk to passengers. No accidents or injuries have been connected to this defect.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nIn early February of this year, Takata engineers performed a round of quality assurance tests and discovered that some air bag assemblies suffered abnormal deployments. QA personnel conducted these trials in areas with temperatures of&nbsp;85 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Soon after the results registered, Takata engineers initiated an internal review to look into the problem. Weeks later, the provider connected with Nissan and shared the results of the air bag tests. The automaker immediately searched its inventory for affected parts, eventually instituting a worldwide quarantine of all Takata air bag assemblies included in the initial QA tests. Most of these fixtures were stored at&nbsp;Nissan production plants in Civac and Aguascalientes, Mexico.</p>\n<p>In March, Takata came forward with conclusive results: A tier-two supplier had shipped out ring plates with faulty metallurgical compositions. The parts, which were light on carbon, failed in high-temperature environments. Nissan immediately initiated audits in its Mexican facilities in an effort to pinpoint and remove the defective air bag ring plates. Over the course of March and April, personnel reviewed more than 1,800 air bag assemblies and found that 616 Versa models included flawed safety features. Nissan QA personnel soon decided to launch a voluntary recall campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nThe automaker has ordered dealers to evaluate the air bag assemblies installed in affected vehicles using a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCRIT-17V275-1087.pdf\">quick scan tool</a>, according to internal documents released to the NHTSA. Should the readings show parts that&nbsp;originate from the defective batch, dealers are to replace the passenger-side air bag module, free of charge. Nissan notified dealers April 27. The company is currently distributing owner notifications and is expected to finish this process by the end of June. Versa owners in need of additional assistance are encouraged to contact the NHTSA.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10960","createdAt":"2017-04-26T11:40:18.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-04-27T01:25:18.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T02:48:13.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T16:33:13.000Z","display_date":"April 26, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":4,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_1329249263-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1329249263-1","category":{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"}]},{"id":10832,"title":"Ford Edge recall addresses windshield header issues","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-edge-recall-addresses-windshield-header-issues/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-edge-recall-addresses-windshield-header-issues","excerpt":"<p>A new Ford recall has to do with windshield header problems which could lead to side impact risk, and therefore not comply with regulations.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dearborn, Mich.—April 19, 2017—A newly announced Ford Edge recall addressed&nbsp;problems with the windshield header in some 2017 Edge vehicles.

The steering assist feature is deactivated, producing an indicator on the instrument cluster. The loss of steering assist requires motorists to manually control the vehicle which can be difficult, especially at low speeds. This increases the likelihood of an accident. No accidents or injuries have been connected to this defect.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On March 6, 2017, representatives from Hyundai&#8217;s international headquarters contacted Hyundai Motor America and communicated a possible defect in EPS systems installed in recently produced Elantra sedans. Engineers at the car company&#8217;s HQ discovered that the power steering motors installed in these vehicles had been damaged during production, could not properly connect to EPS control units and might malfunction, leaving drivers without the steering assist feature. Hyundai Motor America reviewed the claim and the attached field data. No U.S. drivers had come forward with EPS-related problems. Even so, the stateside Hyundai division chose initiate a voluntary recall March 24. Dealers were notified March 31.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Hyundai Motor America has ordered dealers to replace defective EPS motors in affected vehicles. This particular part falls under the original factory warranty, which covers the EPS system and other components for five years or 60,000 miles. Therefore, owners should not incur expenses when taking their vehicles in for service. The automaker intends to notify affected Elantra owners via first-class mail by April 28.<script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10789","createdAt":"2017-04-13T16:14:03.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-04-14T05:59:03.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-03-08T08:21:23.000Z","modified_gmt":"2022-03-08T22:06:23.000Z","display_date":"April 13, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":"","meta_title":"Hyundai Recall - 2017 Hyundai Elantra - Power Steering Problem","meta_description":"Hyundai recalls certain 2017 Hyundai Elantra vehicles equipped with defective electronic power steering systems that fail to connect to the control unit.","meta_keywords":"Hyundai Recall, 2017 Hyundai Elantra, 2017 Hyundai Elantra Recall, Power Steering Problem, power steering failure.","custom_schema":""},"year":2017,"month":4,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_1330246307-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1330246307-1","category":{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"}]},{"id":10791,"title":"Chrysler recalls vehicles with defective software","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalls-vehicles-defective-software/","status":"publish","slug":"chrysler-recalls-vehicles-defective-software","excerpt":"<p>Fiat Chrysler has recalled more than 25,000 500l vehicles with incorrectly calibrated powertrain control software.</p>\n","description":"<p>Auburn Hills, Mich. &#8211; March 21, 2017 &#8211; Fiat Chrysler has recalled more than 25,000 vehicles with incorrectly calibrated software. The recall affects Fiat 500L <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V192-1460.PDF?_ga=1.68782545.1925009649.1491484589\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compact cars</a> produced between March 6, 2013 and Oct. 21, 2014, according to documentation filed with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>Models named in the recall are equipped with incorrectly calibrated powertrain control module software, which has been shown to limit engine capabilities. Drivers have experienced instances in which their vehicles will only idle even when the accelerator is fully engaged.

Roughly one month later, the automaker initiated an investigation and ultimately correlated the problem to faulty accelerator calibration. In September, production staff implemented new gas pedal assemblies to improve accelerator calibration.</li>\n<li>On Dec. 2, 2016, Fiat Chrysler received a field report that indicated diminished drivability among 500L models. The car company launched an investigation and reviewed the performance data included in the field report. Seven days later, engineers determined that accelerator calibration was once again to blame. On Dec. 14, engineers developed revised calibration standards, which were finally published Feb. 6, 2017.</li>\n<li>On Feb. 10, Fiat Chrysler&#8217;s Technical Service Organization issued a service bulletin outlining proposed PCM software updates for 500L models. The car company&#8217;s Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance group reviewed the draft document and outlined risk factors associated with the vehicle, including delayed throttle response and vehicle hesitation. Six days later, the VSRC launched an investigation into the 500L, and after an initial data review upgraded the inquiry Feb. 21.</li>\n<li>On March 2, VSRC notified the Fiat Chrysler home office in Italy and continued to review field reports and other data. By March 6, the group had seen 35 warranty claims, 16 computerized accident reports and 13 field reports related to the defect. On March 9, Fiat Chrysler connected with NHTSA to review the investigation. On March 16, the car maker decided to initiate a voluntary safety recall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Fiat Chrysler is expected to request that dealers update the PCM software on affected models. The car company will reimburse owners for the repair. However, owners must submit service receipts or alternative proof of payment following the update.

This is a safety compliance recall, and the company&nbsp;has said in a statement that <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/03/15/ford-issues-safety-compliance-recall-in-north-america.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the manufacturer has no evidence of any related accidents</a> or injuries.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nThe recall affects 5,756 total vehicles, 5,470 of which were&nbsp;in the U. S., and all of which bear the 2017 model year, produced this year. These vehicles could contain doors with a misaligned spring, prompting the driver-side door to potentially open during a collision. Though this would only happen with the unseated spring, it could still pose a safety risk to occupants.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Events</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Jan. 13-31, 2017:</strong> Ford manufactured the soon-to-be recalled vehicles at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant.<br />\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">March 15, 2017:</strong> Ford released and official statement about the fault.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Resolution</strong></h3>\n<p>Ford plans to fix the&nbsp;fault on behalf of owners for free, following an inspection. Since the fault is located in the return spring, that will presumably be the focus of the repairs.</p>\n<p>This recall echoes a similar action announced last September, which targeted exactly 2,046,297 vehicles in the U.S. alone. This recall included not just the 2015 model year&nbsp;Ford Mustang, but also other models&nbsp;such as the&nbsp;Lincoln MKC and the Ford Transit Connect.</p>\n<p>That number mentioned was actually the total amount&nbsp;after the September expansion, which <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/09/08/ford-expands-door-latch-safety-recall-in-north-america.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">included around 1.5 million vehicles</a> instead of the original number. Instead of the return spring, this other recall pertained to&nbsp;the&nbsp;pawl spring tab, which would have a similar affect of preventing the door from closing. In that case, the resolution was the same, with the manufacturer pledging to replace the faulty latches. As of Sept. 16, 2016,&nbsp;there were three injuries traced back to this fault.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10381","createdAt":"2017-04-03T01:50:02.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-04-03T15:35:02.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T03:19:45.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T17:04:45.000Z","display_date":"April 03, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":4,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_1455111494-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1455111494-1","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]}]
