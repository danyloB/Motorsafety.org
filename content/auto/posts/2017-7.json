The case involves defective flanges, which could crack, possibly <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/news/volkswagen-ag-fuel-tank-flange-leak-recall-millions-article-1.3355138\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">because the material could deteriorate</a>.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen is just one of several manufacturers with possible complications from this issue, and all reportedly stem from the part itself, a Continental Automotive Systems product. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into the matter.</p>\n<p>As the source described, a crack in the flange could also lead to a fuel leak. Major auto companies like Ford and General Motors could have to recall vehicles if they find evidence of the risk. The article quoted a statement from Elizabeth Weigandt, a Ford representative, on the company&#8217;s awareness of the issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unclear at this point whether Ford vehicles are affected,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are reviewing the matter and will cooperate with NHTSA, as we always do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A Part 573 Safety Recall Report submitted to the NHTSA in March said that&nbsp;20,908 Volkswagen Touareg vehicles were <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V151-5079.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">part of that company&#8217;s recall,</a> with the model years ranging from 2007 to 2010. &nbsp;The larger amount of vehicles were produced between 2006 and 2010. This report said that the components could weaken over time due to oxidization and internal pressure. The report said that March was the company&#8217;s &#8220;date of determination.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The resolution to this earlier recall involved fitting the affected flanges with a protective cover. The report said that a fuel smell may indicate the issue, and that there were apparent similarities between this recall and another one for Audi vehicles.</p>\n<p>A Volkswagen dealership communication said that the resolution could <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCMN-17V151-2309.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">require a full replacement</a>&nbsp;if the flanges are cracked.

The campaign affects 2016 Smart Fortwo&nbsp;compact cars manufactured between&nbsp;June 16, 2015 and Aug. 12, 2016. Mercedes estimated that 1 percent of the total number of vehicles named in the recall contain the defective parts.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The vehicles referenced in the campaign could contain bowden cables with defective lock nuts, which may loosen over time and result in an increase in parking brake lever travel.

However, Mercedes-Benz has not received any field reports connecting the defect to accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Daimler Automotive Group, which owns Mercedes-Benz, received a field report in mid-2016 that summarized an instance in which the parking brake on a customer&#8217;s vehicle failed to engage properly. The company immediately initiated a root-cause investigation to understand the cause of this mishap and ascertain whether a more widespread mechanical issue existed. Engineers involved in the inquiry immediately pinpointed a problem with the lock nut on the bowden cable. DAG then contacted its suppliers to identify possible fabrication issues.</p>\n<p>In late 2016, the DAG team investigating the defect discovered that installation of the parking brake during the assembly process may have affected the microencapsulation process, resulting in lock nut hardware prone to slippage. During the opening months of 2017, the car company tested the affects of the defective lock nut assembly. In April, engineers performed additional tests, this time assessing how the feature stood up to vehicle vibrations. Two months later, DAG engineers were able to replicate the original customer complaint via multiple parking brake lever application and release. The automaker then reviewed manufacturing records to determine what vehicles might contain the defect.</p>\n<p>In July 2017, DAG decided that the defect presented a serious safety risk to owners and launched a recall campaign. The organization notified dealers soon after.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>DAG has ordered dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V448-6494.pdf\">replace the lock nuts</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to additional documentation submitted to the NHTSA. The repairs are covered under existing new car warranties and therefore are not subject to official reimbursement plans. Owners should expect to receive notification in September.

The campaign affects 2011-2015 Dodge Journey crossover models produced between Oct. 14, 2010 and April 20, 2015, as well as 2011-2015 Fiat Freemont crossovers sold outside of the North American Free Trade Agreement zone. FCA estimates that 1 percent of the vehicles named in the recall <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V432-5557.PDF\">contain the faulty wiring fixtures</a>, according to documentation filed with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The affected vehicles could come equipped with air bag wiring fixtures that chafe against steering wheel components. In this scenario, short-circuiting is likely. This may lead to unexpected driver-side air bag deployment. FCA has received reports of six injuries connected to the defect. In these cases, the air bag warning light illuminated prior to deployment. Drivers also observed unintended windshield wiper operation.</p>\n<p>The car company has yet to receive reports of any accidents related to the defective wiring fixture.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In October 2014, FCA investigated an <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V432-5258.pdf\">instance of inadvertent air bag deployment</a> involving a Dodge Caravan minivan, according to a chronology document filed with the NHTSA. Engineers reporting to the auto maker&#8217;s Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance group analyzed the issue and suggested the steering column clockspring conductor tape was to blame.</p>\n<p>FCA continued the investigation and in March 2015 determined the actual root cause of the IAD: shorted wires due to friction between the air bag wiring harness and the metal horn plate located within the steering wheel assembly. In May, FCA engineers successfully tested tape-based wiring harness protection, which was then implemented in production facilities in September. This improvement applied to both Caravan and Journey models.</p>\n<p>The car company continued to monitor the issue throughout 2015, while also identifying and quarantining damaged steering wheel assemblies.</p>\n<p>In January 2016, FCA confirmed all of the updated wiring protections for Caravan and Journey vehicles were successfully installed in September 2015. One month later, the company requested a series of vehicle inspections to assess the efficacy of these production improvements.</p>\n<p>In March, engineers conducted 26 corporate vehicle inspections and discovered that three models showed signs of contact between air bag wiring fixtures and steering wheel components. The FCA Quality Engineering Center obtained the inspection results the following month. After an initial review, QEC sent the results to the engineering laboratory, which conducted vehicle vibration tests and found that steering wheel components penetrated the air bag wiring protection. FCA continued to investigate and monitor the issue throughout 2016.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, the VSRC received reports of IADs linked to other causes not addressed in previous investigations. One month later, FCA engineers opened a new inquiry and reviewed parts from the vehicles named in these reports and discovered a separate production anomaly limited in scope.</p>\n<p>FCA closed this new investigation in early February but continued to monitor the issue. Over the course of late February, March and April the auto maker received new IAD reports involving shorted air bag wiring fixtures. It re-opened the brief investigation initiated in January. FCA received additional IAD reports in May.</p>\n<p>On June 6, the Vehicle Regulations Committee conducted voluntary recall for Caravan models and requested more information on the Journey crossover. On June 20, engineers determine that shortened clockspring assemblies were the root cause in IAD instances involving Journeys.The VRC extended the campaign on June 30 to apply to Journey models.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA has directed dealers to inspect the air bag wiring on affected vehicles and replace and reinforce these fixtures, free of charge. Owners are expected to receive notification via first-class mail between Aug. 7 and Aug. 21.

These flawed reference materials feature an image of the Jeep Compass battery terminal with reversed polarities. This not only confuses owners in need of assistance, but also creates a serious safety hazard, as attaching jump starting cables in the manner shown in the instructions may produce a&nbsp;dangerous&nbsp;electrical charge. However, the FCA has not received reports of any accidents or injuries connected to the inaccurate user guides.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On May 31, an FCA supplier reported that the user guides installed in some 2017 Jeep Compass models might contain inaccurate information. The car company&#8217;s Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance group immediately launched an investigation into the supposed issue. Roughly one week later, FCA engineers reviewed the user guides and confirmed that the instructions did indeed contain an error. The VSRC group then initiated an internal review in search of customer complaints, injury reports or warranty claims connected to the defective user guides. This review ultimately uncovered one customer complaint mentioning the inaccurate materials.</p>\n<p>On June 30, the FCA Vehicle Regulations Committee reviewed the findings and recommended an immediate voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA will order dealers to distribute accurate user guides containing correct jump-starting directions. The automaker has pledged to reimburse owners for the amended instructions, provided they can submit proof of purchase in the form of a receipt or other documentation.

According to a posting on Car Complaints, the affected autos were <a href=\"https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2017/jaguar-recalls-xj-over-airbag-software.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">from the model years of 2010 and 2011</a>, and the software in the restraint control module was said to not allow them to function properly. The recall follows an investigation into the calibration of these systems, which changed after an improper update.</p>\n<p>The recall is set to begin this August and will, as the source said, make up for the fact that the warranty period has expired in these vehicles. Fixing these vehicles will involve updating the software to reflect the correct calibration, and therefore help reduce air bag deployment issues in the event of impact.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Jaguar XJ was part of a different air bag-related recall.

This campaign, which is an amendment to an earlier recall conducted in November 2013, affects a number of BMW models, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2006&nbsp;325i, 325xi, 330i and&nbsp;330xi sedans</li>\n<li>2006&nbsp;325xi station&nbsp;wagons</li>\n<li>2006&nbsp;525i, 525xi, 530i, 530xi and 550i sedans</li>\n<li>2006&nbsp;530xi station&nbsp;wagons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BMW estimates that 6 percent of the total vehicles named in the recall contain the defective components.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The vehicles included in this recall may come equipped with occupant detection mats susceptible to microcracking.

In this scenario, passenger safety features such as air bags would fail to deploy in the event of a crash. This poses serious risks to passengers, who could be left unprotected should a serious accident occur.</p>\n<p>BMW has yet to receive reports connecting the defect to accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In 2008, BMW conducted recalls in Canada and the&nbsp;U.S. to address <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2013/RCDNN-13V564-8482P.pdf\">nonworking passenger detection mats</a>, according to internal documents submitted to the NHTSA. The car company also introduced new mat models featuring alloy into production facilities. Four years later, the Canadian transportation department contacted BMW regarding customer complaints surrounding the improved detection mats. From November 2012 to March 2013, BMW engineers reviewed the complaints and the associated vehicles and determined that the alloy mats were defective. In April of that year, the automaker initiated a recall campaign in Canada.</p>\n<p>One month later, it launched an investigation in the U.S. to determine if American owners were also dealing with problematic passenger detection mats. While initial NHTSA database surveys yielded low numbers of warranty claims related to the defect, a more exhaustive review conducted in August 2013 revealed claim rates similar to those in the Canadian market. With this data in hand, BMW decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In April 2017, the NHTSA reached out to BMW and requested information on models named in the 2013 recall. The agency realized that some of these vehicles had been mentioned in recent customer complaints regarding passenger detection mats. BMW and the NHTSA came to the conclusion in May that some 2006 models had been left out of the 2013 campaign. Over the coming weeks, both parties analyzed production data and assembled a definitive list of vehicles whose passenger detection equipment needed to be replaced.</p>\n<p>On June 28, BMW launched a voluntary safety recall to address these remaining models. The car company notified dealers July 6.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>BMW has ordered dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V428-2951.pdf\">replace the passenger detection mats</a> in affected vehicles free of charge.
