A critical steering component could fail due to corrosion problems. This is an expansion of an earlier recall from 2018. As many as 49,339 vehicles may be affected.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V323-6826.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report</a> on this issue, the front cross member, a part of the vehicle suspension, may corrode after exposure to road salt over time due to insufficient paint coating on the component. If the part fails, it can lead to breakage of the cross member, sudden changes in steering alignment and reduced steering control, particularly in situations such as driving over a pothole at high speed. This could result in the increased risk of crash and injury.</p>\n<h2>Signs Of Trouble</h2>\n<p>A story by Consumer Reports said that <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/mazda6-recalled-suspension-corrosion-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vehicle owners may notice the problem when they hear an unusual noise</a> resulting from the front wheel touching a piece of the vehicle trim, or when the steering wheel becomes off-center. The noise can be heard both outside and inside the vehicle. Mechanics may also be able to detect the problem when the car is taken in for service.</p>\n<h2>Timeline Of Events</h2>\n<p>On Sept. 14, 2018 Mazda originally submitted a defect information report to NHTSA concerning 2009-2010 Mazda6 vehicles experiencing corrosion of the cross member due to road salt.</p>\n<p>Between September and December 2018, the automaker received a number of new field reports indicating that the same condition was affecting 2011 vehicles. On Jan. 11, 2019, Transport Canada sent Mazda an inquiry about cross member corrosion in Mazda6 2011-2013 vehicles. Following discussion with Transport Canada, Mazda decided March 21 to respond to the inquiry after conducting an investigation of the issue and evaluating the need for field action.</p>\n<p>On April 22, the automaker concluded that 2011-2013 vehicles were subject to the same defect as those recalled earlier. After a review by the Quality Audit Committee, Mazda launched a proactive field action for all affected vehicles.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The recall will begin June 24, 2019. Mazda will notify owners by mail, instructing them to take their vehicles to the nearest dealership for inspection. Depending on the condition of the vehicle, dealers will either install a side member and a drain hose and apply wax to protect from rust, or they will install a drain hose and an improved front cross member, at no cost to vehicle owners. In addition, a reimbursement plan is available for eligible owners who already paid to have these repairs done.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Mazda customer service at 1-800-222-5500 Option 4. Mazda&#8217;s number for this recall is 2818I. This recall is an expansion of Recall 18V-631.

The steering wheel cores of these cars may have metal burrs, which can damage wiring harnesses contained within them. This could disable the driver&#8217;s air bag or unexpectedly trigger deployment without any prior warning. As many as 118,598 vehicles may be affected.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V383-7126.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report</a> on this issue, the affected vehicles may have metal burrs on the steering wheel core that could cut or damage the wiring harnesses routed through the core, including the wires for the driver&#8217;s air bag. If this were to occur, the air bag could unexpectedly activate with no warning, or it could fail to operate in the event of a crash. The result of either of these situations would be an increased risk of accident or injury.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Honda first learned of the problem Jan. 24, 2019, when a warning light flashed on a new CR-V vehicle being assembled. Technicians tracking down the cause discovered that a short circuit in the cable reel sub-harness had blown a fuse, most likely due to burrs on the core of the steering wheel that damaged a misrouted sub-harness.</p>\n<p>As soon as this problem was reported, all North American manufacturing facilities developed and put into place new quality process improvements. On Jan. 25, Honda and its steering wheel supplier began a joint investigation into the causes and consequences of the issue. By Jan. 31, the supplier changed the steering wheel core trim tool to prevent potential burring.</p>\n<p>The automaker received its first and second market claims of faulty air bag activation between February and late March. Honda then collected the failed parts for root-cause analysis, which later confirmed that an improperly routed cable reel sub-harness was indeed susceptible to damage caused by burrs on the steering wheel core.</p>\n<p>From April to early May, Honda received four additional claims of unexpected air bag deployment (then totalling six in all). As before, the failed parts were collected and analyzed. By this time, the automaker determined that a motor vehicle safety defect existed and decided May 14 to conduct a recall. As of that date, Honda had received 41 warranty claims, 20 field reports, three injury reports and no reports of full-on crashes related to this issue.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The recall is expected to start July 8, 2019. Honda will notify all affected vehicle owners, directing them to return their CR-V vehicles to the nearest Honda dealership for inspection and repairs. Dealers will install a new protective cover on the steering wheel core as well as replacing the clockspring and harnesses within the core, at no charge to vehicle owners.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138.

The affected vehicles are equipped with a front passenger air bag inflator that may have been incorrectly installed during a previous recall and replacement field action. As many as 19,086 vehicles may be affected.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V378-9796.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report</a> on this issue, during a previous replacement process the front passenger air bag inflators may have been improperly installed on the affected vehicles. In the event of a crash, these inflators may not deploy as expected, increasing the likelihood of injury to vehicle occupants.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>From September 2017 through May 2018, following up on a prior air&nbsp;bag inflator mis-installation recall, Honda began a series of meetings, dealer visits, training courses, workshops and supplemental job aids aimed at educating service technicians and avoiding incorrect&nbsp;air&nbsp;bag inflator installations during future recall actions. As a result of this initiative, additional mis-installations were identified, and Honda submitted a defect information report to NHTSA on April 26, 2018 to address the situation.</p>\n<p>Honda and NHTSA met Sept. 19, 2018 to review the audit results of inflator repairs performed at certain dealerships and to decide on a solution. The automaker agreed to expand the recall to include the known population of potentially affected vehicles as well as to audit the repairs that had been done by service technicians who were no longer employed by Honda or Acura dealerships before May 2018.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 20, Honda decided that a motor vehicle safety defect existed, launching a safety recall expansion for the preceding NHTSA 18V-268 action. The automaker also submitted an amended defect information report for that recall on Sept. 27 and conducted a nationwide audit from&nbsp;September 2018 to April 2019 on the repair workmanship of the affected vehicles. This newest audit would focus on the involvement of service technicians who were&nbsp;no longer employed by Acura or Honda dealerships prior to May 2018.</p>\n<p>Honda gave NHTSA an update on the audit progress April 23. Consequently, the automaker decided May 9 to conduct a safety recall. As of that date, no field reports, warranty claims or reports of injuries or deaths related to this issue had been received by Honda.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>A recall is expected to begin June 28, 2019. Honda will inform all vehicle owners, and dealers will inspect the inflator installation and, as needed, replace the front passenger air bag module assembly at no cost to the owners of the affected vehicles.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138.

When the transmission gear does not match what is shown by the lever, the vehicle could move in an unexpected direction, including rolling away&nbsp;while in the Park position unless the parking brake is engaged before leaving the vehicle. These problems may increase the risk of injury or crashes affecting vehicle occupants, passersby and any autos in the vicinity.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Ford learned of the problem April 25, 2019 when two warranty reports indicated issues with vehicles not starting as well as rolling away while in Park. One report involved a vehicle in which the gear shifter was in the Park position while the instrument panel displayed Drive, resulting in the inability to start. In the other report, the vehicle did not start, did not register as being in&nbsp;Park&nbsp;and rolled when the shifter indicated Park. In both situations, the issue was attributed to loose or missing transmission shift cable bracket fasteners. Ford&#8217;s Critical Concern Review Group began an investigation upon learning of these reports.</p>\n<p>Following a review of assembly plant records, it was discovered that a manual torque verification process had been temporarily substituted for the automated installation and torque verification for the shift cable bracket fasteners. This happened in vehicles produced between March 5 and March 13. The automaker conducted an audit of the 277 vehicles manufactured during this time frame and found four vehicles with improperly torqued transmission shift cable bracket fasteners.</p>\n<p>Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee approved a field action May 6. As of that date, the automaker was not aware of any reports of accident or injury related to these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>A recall is expected to begin July 1, 2019. Ford will inform&nbsp;owners, instructing them to bring affected vehicles back to the dealership for repair. Dealers will inspect and tighten the transmission shift cable bracket fasteners as needed.

Because of this issue, the vehicles do not comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 201, &#8220;Occupant Protection in Interior Impact.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>BMW conducted development tests in January 2019 on its next-generation X1 model. The results showed that one of the B-pillar target points exceeded the recommended value, indicating a safety issue. Since the new generation of X1 models are identical to the current X1 version now on the road, the automaker decided to revisit its prior certification results, finding that those earlier tests came out within the legal requirements for the B-pillar values. BMW then conducted further review of the discrepancies between the two versions.</p>\n<p>Further tests were conducted April 3, showing that one of the B-pillar values still exceeded the recommendation. In response, additional reviews of test setup equipment and simulations took place in April, followed by evaluation from an independent testing laboratory. The lab repeated BMW&#8217;s earlier tests, coming up with similar results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Engineering analysis by the automaker then revealed that the engineering services company that had conducted the initial tests and simulations for the new generation X1 vehicles&#8217; B-pillar contact point had failed to take into account a worst-case scenario for head-form positioning. As a result, BMW decided May 2 to launch a voluntary recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The recall is expected to begin July 2, 2019. A repair solution is still under development.

In one part of the vehicle population affected by the defect, the cause was traced to a transmission grease that was not compatible with the bushing material; in the other trucks, the automaker could not find any root cause.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the first field-service action, Ford continued to investigate the origin of the defect, monitoring field data on vehicles not included in the original field action. From Aug. 2018 to April 2019, the automaker held periodic reviews of the matter, sharing results of its tests and internal investigations on an ongoing basis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From April to May, Ford&#8217;s continuing investigation embraced powertrain package studies, part return engineering analysis, material robustness testing to under-hood fluids and analysis of updated field data. As a result, the automaker determined that the shifter cable bushing in the affected vehicles was performing differently than in other Ford powertrains. Consequently, Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee decided May 13 to approve a field action.</span></p>\n<h3><b>The Solution</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recall is expected to begin May 28, 2019. A solution for the problem is still under development. Until repairs can be made, vehicle owners are advised to use the parking brake after shifting into Park to prevent roll-away. When a remedy is finalized, the automaker will contact vehicle owners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332.

Because of a manufacturing defect, the seat cushions may not remain locked in place in certain situations, such as when an unexpected stop occurs, or during a crash. In the event of an accident, there is a greater likelihood of injury for rear seat passengers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Description of Cause</h3>\n<p>According to the manufacturer, if the back frame weldment is too narrow and it is fastened to the seat base weldment, this could potentially result in a deformation of the dump mechanism.

As many as 94 vehicles may be affected.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V320-8451.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report</a> on this recall action, the affected 2018 Jeep Wrangler vehicles have a roof top tent installed in which the top cover may break or crack under extreme weather conditions. As a result, the cover could detach from the vehicle. If this were to happen while the vehicle is moving, it could create a road hazard, increasing the chance of a crash.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>American Fastbacks first learned of the problem in November 2018, when dealerships in the Midwest reported that&nbsp;covers on the&nbsp;Wrangler roof top tents were cracking due to extreme cold weather. The company, believing it was a quality control defect, started looking for a new supplier.</p>\n<p>Additional complaints were received in February 2019, followed by a dealer report April 17 that the roof top cracking was not a cosmetic issue, but rather one that posed a significant&nbsp;safety concern.</p>\n<p>American Fastbacks had already instituted an earlier recall of the affected vehicles for another issue. After discussion of the new problem with the NHTSA, the company decided to announce a separate recall for the roof top tent defect.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The recall will begin in May 2019. A&nbsp;solution to the roof-cover defect&nbsp;is still under development.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact American Fastbacks customer service at 1-844-533-7997 extension 301.

If the air bag does not operate properly during a crash, there is a&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;increased risk of injury for the passenger in the front seat.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>BMW learned from its supplier on March 20, 2019 that instrument panels in the affected vehicles may have been fastened with an adhesive not originally specified by the automaker during the course of the lamination process. BMW immediately launched an investigation to determine whether that&nbsp;improper adhesive had, in fact, been used, and learn which&nbsp;vehicles contained the problematic instrument panel cluster modules. Production was halted at the assembly plant as soon as the investigation began.</p>\n<p>Further review by both BMW and the component&nbsp;supplier revealed the specific production dates during which the incorrect&nbsp;adhesive was potentially used in manufacturing the vehicles&#8217; instrument panels. Based on this information, BMW decided April 3 to launch a voluntary recall. As of that date, the automaker had not received any reports of injuries or accidents related to this issue.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The recall will formally&nbsp;begin June 3, 2019. BMW will notify owners of the affected vehicles, explaining to them that authorized&nbsp;dealers will replace the flawed&nbsp;instrument panel assembly at no cost.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact BMW customer service at 1-800-525-7417.

The front passenger seat mounting bolts may be loose. The resulting seat movement in the event of a crash could increase the risk of injury. As many as 253 vehicles may be affected.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V248-3650.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report</a> on this problem, some 2019 Jeep Cherokee vehicles built at the Belvidere Assembly Plant could have front passenger seat mounting fasteners that were not tightened to the correct torque. When this happens, it could lead to the increased risk of passenger injury in an accident.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Chrysler&#8217;s U.S. Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization first received word Jan. 22, 2019 of three vehicles from the first shift of Nov. 26, 2018 with front seat passenger seat mounting bolt torques below specification, and opened an investigation.</p>\n<p>Further testing in January showed that vehicles built with front passenger seats not fully fastened down may not reliably be detected when test-driven. After reviewing Belvidere assembly records, Chrysler discovered that torque traceability records had been compromised. The automaker concluded that three factors contributed to the torque traceability problem: an untrained operator, improper tool tethering that allowed the operator to work out of the station and a fastener tool with limited torque traceability.</p>\n<p>As of March 21, Chrysler had not received any complaints or field reports related to the issue, nor were they aware of any incidents or injuries resulting from the problem. Despite the absence of any such troubling reports or warranty claims, the automaker decided March 21 to conduct a voluntary safety recall of the affected vehicles.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The recall formally began April 11, 2019. Chrysler has notified owners, and dealers will inspect the affected vehicles and if needed tighten the mounting bolts, free of charge. Consistent with past practices, the automaker will reimburse Jeep Cherokee owners who have incurred the cost of repairing a problem that subsequently became the subject of a field action; Chrysler requests that customers send the original receipt and/or other adequate proof of payment to the company for confirmation of the expense.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Chrysler customer service at 1-800-853-1403.
