Specifically, the circuit boards installed in these components are prone to heat due to a critical design flaw. Consequently, electric auxiliary water pumps using these circuit boards might overheat to an extent that causes smoldering, which in turn increases the likelihood of engine fire. This threat poses a serious safety hazard to occupants. However, BMW has yet to receive reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Timeline of Events</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMW engineers first noticed instances of </span><a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2012/RCDNN-12V008-7102.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electric auxiliary water pump failure back in June 2009, according to an earlier defect report submitted to the NHTSA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This discovery prompted additional internal testing, which revealed an issue with the circuit board assemblies installed in the pumps. Later in September 2009, Mini, a BMW brand, discovered a vehicle that suffered electric auxiliary water pump failure. BMW initiated a field monitoring program in response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May and June 2010, the automaker came across two other vehicles that showed signs of engine compartment burning. This finding prompted BMW to form a special task force to address the issue. The group, in November 2010, confirmed that the vehicles experienced engine compartment fires due to electric auxiliary water pump failure linked to circuit board degradation. In September 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalls-vehicles-defective-water-pumps/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chrysler recalled several models that presented the same fire risk due to water pump failures</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company continued to monitor the field for the next year, during which time 81 vehicles worldwide suffered electric auxiliary water pump failure. Four of these vehicles experienced engine compartment fires.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In December 2011, BMW completed internal tests involving both BMW and Mini vehicles. On Jan. 3, 2012, the automaker initiated a voluntary safety recall involving more than 88,000 vehicles across both brands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than four years later in October 2017, BMW received a field report detailing an instance of electric auxiliary water pump failure in a 2011 Mini Cooper S. The company evaluated the vehicle referenced in the report and confirmed the root cause.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMW then found that this particular model was not included in the 2012 recall, which forced it to reassess its engineering and field data. This review revealed multiple instances in which BMW had inspected damaged vehicles that showed signs of electric auxiliary water pump failure, including BMW 550i and 750i sedans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The automaker then launched a formal review of the amended electric auxiliary water pump assemblies installed in vehicles following the 2012 recall campaign and found that these fixtures were failure-prone despite the presence of enlarged circuit path spaces, hall sensor holder gaps and improved plating and soldering.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMW reviewed its production records and determined that models across its brand, Mini and Rolls Royce were affected. On April 11, 2018, the car manufacturer initiated another voluntary safety recall.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The Solution</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V248-4385.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMW has directed dealers to replace the electric auxiliary water pumps</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document. However, the automaker is still developing replacement parts. That said, the company plans to reach out to owners June 11, and once more when replacement fixtures become available. Owners in need of assistance prior to the start of the recall can connect with BMW customer service personnel by calling (800) 525-7417. Mini owners should call (866) 825-1525, while individuals with recalled Rolls Royce vehicles should use (877) 877-3735. Owners can, of course, contact the NHTSA directly using its Vehicle Safety Hotline at (888) 327-4236.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost 48,000 vehicles are included in this GM recall.

Most of these vehicles were sold in so-called &#8220;salt-belt states,&#8221; or states that experience significant winter precipitation and therefore consistently deploy corrosive road salt. The car manufacturer expanded this recall June 5, 2012, this time including 2006-2007 Jeep Liberty models. On Aug. 16, 2016, the FCA Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization launched an investigation following the receipt of customer complaints involving 2004-2007 Jeep Liberty SUVs that were not included in the two earlier safety campaigns.

In March, the survey team returned with results: 2004-2007 Jeep Liberty SUVs in other states were indeed equipped with lower control arms that showed signs of internal and external corrosion. Despite these findings, the VSRC decided to close its investigation April 6, 2017, and switch back to field monitoring, which continued for more than a year. On April 23, 2018, the group took stock of the field monitoring data. More than 157 reports had been filed pertaining to 2004-2007 Jeep Liberty SUVs not included in the original recalls.

The vehicle did not contain aftermarket parts, indicating that the condition may not be linked to the installation of such non-standard components. As a result, Hyundai initiated a field review.</div>\n<div>The automaker received two additional reports centered on AAS non-deployment between July and November 2016. While one was invalidated by investigators, the second involved a 2011 Hyundai Sonata sedan with potential ASIC damage linked to overstress. Hyundai launched an official investigation in response. Then, in November 2017, OSHA&#8217;s&nbsp;Office of Defects Investigation contacted the car company to check on the status of the inquiry. Hyundai submitted data related to the investigation and established a communication channel for updates. One month later, the automaker hired an external engineering firm to look into the ACU issue.</div>\n<div>On February 21, 2018, Hyundai and ZF TRW met to discuss the state of the ongoing investigation, with the latter coming to the conclusion that transient charges, originating from adjacent vehicle parts, were causing electrical overstress in the ASIC assemblies and therefore affecting ACU performance. One day later, members of Hyundai&#8217;s Technical Committee convened and determined that a voluntary recall involving affected&nbsp;2011 Hyundai Sonata sedans was necessary. Following this action, the automaker continued its investigation into the problematic ACU components.</div>\n<div>ODI&nbsp;officials and Hyundai met in Washington D.C. March 9, 2018, to discuss the inquiry and the initial findings from the third-party engineering firm. It was during this meeting that Hyundai revealed that its external collaborator had determined that the ACU failure was the result of equipment failure &#8211; specifically a lack of&nbsp;circuit-protecting diodes. The automaker attested to replicating the equipment-related damage in a series of crash tests. This discovery expanded the pool of potentially affected models to include Hyundai Sonata and Sonata Hybrid sedans produced in 2012 and 2013. On April 3, 2018, the two parties met once more to review the ongoing investigation.</div>\n<div>Between April 11, 2018, and April 12, 2018, Hyundai collaborated with&nbsp;ZF TRW to review the ACU damage sustained in the previously conducted crash tests. Both automaker and vendor agreed hat the ASIC assemblies in these components shorted due to lack of diodes. On April 18, 2018, the Hyundai TC&nbsp;decided to expand the existing recall, an action the group communicated to both dealers and owners April 20, 2018.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>The Solution</b></span></div>\n<div>Hyundai has&nbsp;<a id=\"LPlnk871648\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V137-3210.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"LPlnk871648\">not yet developed a viable remedy</span></a>, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgment document.
