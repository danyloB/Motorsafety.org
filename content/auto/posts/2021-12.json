Those with no expenses are still eligible to receive up to $500.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Takata airbags contain an inflator that is at risk of exploding when the airbag is deployed. Exploding inflators pose a serious threat to the safety of car occupants, sending sharp shrapnel flying at drivers’ and passengers’ bodies. Reuters reported that as of September this year,<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vw-reaches-42-million-settlement-with-us-owners-over-takata-air-bags-2021-09-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Takata airbags had killed 28 people and injured over 400 worldwide. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Takata airbag recall settlements</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Audi and Volkswagen are not the first automakers to settle a suit over the defective airbags. The following car companies have settled class action lawsuits with current and former owners:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>BMW, $131 million</li><li>Ford, $299.1 million</li><li>Honda, $605 million</li><li>Mazda, $75.8 million</li><li>Nissan, $97.7 million</li><li>Subaru, $68.2 million</li><li>Toyota, $278.5 million</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of <strong>a</strong> recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to court documents, 35% of recalled Takata inflators in Volkswagen and Audi vehicles still need repairs.

As this fluid mixes with exhaust gases, it will create “smoldering particles”.  This may cause the plastic intake manifold  to melt or even result in a fire inside the engine compart]ment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intake manifold &#8220;supplies the fuel/air mixture to the cylinders&#8221; for optimal engine performance, according to a Wikipedia article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V907000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The full list of vehicles is available here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall background</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=18V755\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vehicles that are part of this recall were recalled for the same issue  in 2018</a>. However, field data showed that the repair was not sufficient which prompted the manufacturer to call them in for repairs once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An engine fire increases the risk of a crash, with flames and smoke distracting the driver. Another risk is the inability to stop and leave the vehicle in time, leading to an injury or even death. <a href=\"http://motorsafety.org/bmw-hybrids-recalled-for-contaminated-battery-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">For tips on what to do in the event of a fire, please refer to the following page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several signs that may alert a driver about this issue, including a “low coolant” warning light on the dashboard and an unusual odor from the exhaust. In more severe cases, the engine may lose power and there might be some smoke&nbsp; coming from under the hood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other BMW recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these vehicles may have been a part of a recall in August, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-recalls-vehicles-over-a-risk-of-engine-stalling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">which was caused by a high-pressure fuel pump that suffers from excessive wear</a>. In addition, even vehicles with gasoline engines, such as the 328i station wagon, had problems with their fuel pumps in the past.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, BMW authorized dealers will replace the EGR module and clean the pipe that connects to it. In addition, they will check the intake manifold for any damage and replace it if necessary. All repairs will be done free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notifications about the repair will be sent to vehicle owners around January 12, 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle a part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This BMW coolant leak recall includes more than 50,000 vehicles.
