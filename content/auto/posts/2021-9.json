The supplier applied too much protective coating to the toe links, paradoxically causing the coating to flake off. The protective coating repels debris and prevents corrosion from road salt. Without the coating, the metal toe links may wear down and snap, allowing the rear wheels to wobble left and right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Background of the recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The expansion is a result of an internal GM investigation conducted on the heels of a previous recall.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear suspension toe links hold the back wheels straight.

The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Jaguar F- Pace SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2021 &#8211; 2022 Jaguar F- Type sports cars</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Jaguar XF luxury cars</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The faulty component in this recall is the<strong> </strong>seat belt assembly,<strong> </strong>with multiple part numbers, including 636655200 and 639430300.  This is the second recall by Tata Motors because of this issue, caused by faulty parts supplied by Swedish-American manufacturer Autoliv.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem stems from a faulty seat belt mechanism. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagen-recalls-over-45000-vehicles-with-risk-of-injury-to-children/\" target=\"_blank\">There are two ways to secure a child car seat in a vehicle, and one is to utilize the seat belt</a>, using retractors, which are parts used to hold it in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The retractor that secures a child seat is called the automatic locking retractor (ALR). <a href=\"https://gwrco.com/latest_news/difference-elr-alr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">It locks once “the continuous motion of spooling the belt out is stopped</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a supplier manufacturing issue, the ALR may deactivate and allow the seat belt to become loose, potentially allowing the child seat to move around.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to research conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), car seats reduce deaths by 71% for infants under one year old, and by 54% for kids between one and four. In 2017 alone, car seats saved an estimated 312 lives among children under the age of five. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If car seats are not tightly secured, they will not offer this level of protection. <a href=\"http://.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The defective Jaguar seat belt poses “an increased risk of injury in a crash” to a child in a car seat, according to the recall document.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has not yet released any instructions for owners on how to protect child passengers from this defect. The supplier did say the defect does not affect child car seats secured using anchors and tethers (e.g., “LATCH system”) on the seat. Find out<a href=\"https://thecarseatlady.com/the-latch-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> which car seats use anchors and tethers in this article.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover also did not detail any warning signs that indicate a faulty seat belt. However, documents for an identical recall by <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-more-than-40000-vans-due-to-faulty-seat-belts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mercedes-Benz have reported an “audible clicking noise” drivers may hear when the seat belt is locked</a>. If the clicking noise stops before the seat belt is fully retracted, the seat belt may be faulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected seat belts will be replaced free of charge by Jaguar dealers. Owners should receive letters with more information on October 22, 2201</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Jaguar recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/multiple-land-rover-suvs-recalled-over-unsecured-child-seats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tata recalled 28,000 Land Rover SUVs affected by the same issue</a>. Over 7,000 Land Rover Defenders were recalled in the same month because of  incorrect child restraint information in the owner’s manual, as reported. In March, there was also a Jaguar recall for defective high beams involving over 26,000 vehicles. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 9,000 vehicles are included in this Jaguar recall.

The issue is caused by faulty Takata inflators.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Auburn Hills, MI &#8211; September 3, 2021</em> &#8211; The Volkswagen Group (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) has recalled 62,812 vehicles over a concern that the airbags may not properly deploy in the event of a crash, increasing the risk of a serious injury or death. The affected vehicles include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2000 – 2001 Audi TT</strong>, <strong>including Roadster and Coupe cars</strong></li><li><strong>2000 – 2002 Audi S4</strong></li><li><strong>2000 – 2002 Audi A4</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected part is a Takata Non-Azide Driver Airbag Inflators (NADI) with part numbers 4B0.951.403 and 4B0.951.403 A. This recall is different from the ongoing Takata airbag recall and serves as an expansion of a previous recall for some of the same models issued in February 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall stems from a faulty airbag inflator that may slow down the deployment of the driver airbag in the event of a crash. Alternatively, the inflator may cause excessive pressure when inflating the airbag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V470-2192.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cause of the defect is unclear but is thought to stem from a variety of factors, including &#8220;manufacturing variations [and] climatic conditions</a>.&#8221; There have been no reported cases of delayed inflation of the airbag in the affected models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported, the NADI airbags have a defect that is similar to – but separate from – the larger Takata airbag recall, which involves a different type of inflator.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/category/takata-airbag-recalls/\">That larger recall has affected millions of vehicles across the country</a> and stems from faulty airbags inflators that can rupture during deployment, hurling metal shrapnel at the car occupants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The driver’s airbag plays a vital role in mitigating a serious upper-body injury in the event of a crash. In the event that it does not deploy, there is a higher risk of an injury for the driver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side – although Audi does not state this explicitly – <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-recalls-several-different-1999-2001-vehicles-over-takata-airbag-defect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">if the airbag deploys too forcefully, the inflator may burst and maim or kill the car occupants with its fragments</a>, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Similar Audi airbag recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last couple of years, Volkswagen has issued multiple recalls to replace Takata airbag inflators, including one in January of this year for over 100,000 of Beetle compact and convertible cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the Audi models in this recall, including the Audi TT Roadster, TT Coupe, and A4, were also <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/air-bags-on-volkswagen-vehicles-may-not-properly-inflate-prompting-recall/\" target=\"_blank\">recalled in February 2020</a>, for the same issue.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The driver’s side airbag will be replaced with an alternative, newly designed inflator that uses a different propellant, which is a substance that is used to inflate the airbag. Owners were set to be notified on August 20, 2021, and are slated to receive a second notification once the parts become available in mid-October.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An airbag that fails to deploy correctly is a serious hazard.
