In addition to this, 849 of these models have been categorized as unreachable and 380 have been removed from the recall. All these 2018-2021 Jeep Wranglers that had these Clutch Pressure Plate issues were remedied during 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Auburn Hills, MI – February 11,&nbsp; 2021</em> – <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalls-jeep-wranglers-and-gladiators-for-burnt-out-clutch/\">Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), which owns the Jeep brand, is recalling 42,887 Jeeps</a> because a part of the clutch may overheat and fracture, creating the risk of a fire. The recall includes the following manual transmission vehicles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2018 Jeep Wranglers</strong></li><li><strong>2019 Jeep Wranglers</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Jeep Wranglers</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Jeep Wranglers</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Jeep Gladiators</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Jeep Gladiators</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall concerns the clutch, specifically the clutch pressure plate, which temporarily stops the “transmission of engine power” to allow the driver to switch gears. Due to excessive friction because of a design error, the plate may overheat. The heat may fracture the pressure plate and the resulting hot debris could land on flammable parts of the car, causing a fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Prior recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All vehicles that were part of a<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V124-6513.PDF\"> similar Jeep recall in 2020</a> are included in this latest recall. In this recall, Jeep blamed the problem on “air in the hydraulic system,” and the repair involved rerouting the vehicles’ wiring. Testing performed for this recall showed that with excess friction, the clutch could reach 2,012 degrees Fahrenheit, plenty hot to ignite other parts of the car. It is not clear whether this latest recall supersedes the first one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recent Jeep recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In December of 2021, 2,903 2021 <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/stellantis-recalls-jeep-wrangler-hybrids-with-faulty-odometers/\">Jeep Wranglers were recalled due to faulty odometers that may fail to display the distance traveled.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/fca-recalls-jeep-and-ram-vehicles-for-seat-belt-malfunction/\">A Jeep recall in 2019 of 2011-2018 Wranglers</a> concerned a weak seat belt mount which could fracture and separate from the seat, rendering the belt useless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>‘The entire vehicle was burned to ashes’</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has received numerous complaints describing burning clutch smells, fractured clutch pressure plates and clutch-related fires in vehicles included in the 2020 and 2021 recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many drivers reported a “burning clutch smell.” This odor may be a sign that the clutch pressure plate is about to fail, according to Chrysler’s report to NHTSA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other complaints illustrate the worst-case scenario. “While my 16-year-old daughter and I were driving on the FL 528/Beachline Expressway, the entire clutch pressure plate assembly exploded off my vehicle,” said one Florida driver’s report. “Fluids drained and ignited. The entire vehicle was burned to ashes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the dramatic nature of the accident, no injuries have been reported thus far in connection with the latest recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety concerns</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrysler acknowledged that a fractured clutch pressure plate could also generate road debris, creating a hazard for other drivers on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle fires increase drivers’ and passengers’ risk of injury or death. You can read<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagen-recalls-nearly-13000-audi-luxury-sedans-for-engine-fire-risk/\"> more about what to do if you smell something burning while driving in this article about a 2020 Audi recall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrysler will add software to affected Jeeps that will reduce the engine torque – essentially how hard the engine works – if the clutch starts getting too hot. Owners who have already paid to repair their clutch pressure plate may be eligible for reimbursement. Recall notification letters will be sent to owners on March 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 42,000 vehicles are included in this Chrysler recall.

The display system relied on flash memory hardware, an 8GB multi-media card (eMMc), that could not endure the high-intensity demands of the Tesla car&#8217;s software and eventually ran out of memory.

The defect can also have other effects on how the car starts, shifts gears and drives. The affected part number is 25230 79917.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2013 Nissan Pathfinders</strong></li><li><strong>2014 Nissan Pathfinders</strong></li><li><strong>2015 Nissan Pathfinders</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The brake light switch is a sensor that tells other parts of the car&nbsp; &#8211; the brake lights, the gear shift and sometimes the ignition &#8211; that a driver is pressing the brake.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Nissan Pathfinder recall expands and supersedes a prior recall initiated in May 2016. The original recall was conducted because of a defect which caused the switch to turn on and off in rapid succession <a href=\"https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/94876-switches-relays-cut-the-chatter#at-a6fdb1d1-7edf-4a06-9b76-9378ae3e87a1:~:text=However%2C%20contact%20bounce%20is%20the%20uncontrolled,of%20contacts%20due%20to%20external%20forces.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">due to the movement and vibration of the car</a>, eventually damaging the switch until it was stuck in the “on” position. This made the Pathfinders “think” the brake was being pressed when it was not, causing a whole host of driving issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new recall includes certain 2013-2015 Pathfinders manufactured at Nissan’s Smyrna plant in Tennessee from 2012 to 2017. The first recall only covered 2013 and 2014 Pathfinders manufactured from 2012 to 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nissan has not disclosed why the previous recall has failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Switching gears when it “wants to”</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading up to this recall, Pathfinder owners filed a litany of complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), describing their harrowing experiences with the brake light switch and related issues.

If the brake lights are constantly on, other drivers will not know when a car is actually braking, increasing the risk of a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defect also allows drivers to start the car and shift out of park without pressing on the brake.
