Due to a manufacturing issue, the replacement NADI inflator can absorb moisture, causing the airbag to rupture or underinflate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All listed vehicles may have had these devices installed during repairs. In the event of a crash, a rupture of the inflator can result in dangerous metal fragments hitting drivers and passengers, while an underinflated airbag can fail to shield the occupants properly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These issues increase the risk of severe injury or death. BMW has not provided any guidance on how to ascertain if a vehicle possesses the defective NADI inflators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owners should exercise caution; a solution is not yet available at this time, and BMW recommends that owners should not utilize their vehicles until safe removal processes are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Timeline of events</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 26, 2019, manufacturer Takata (TK Global LLC) disclosed that some of their NADI inflators produced from 1995 &#8211; 2000 were defective and issued a recall for all known extant units and vehicles that may contain said units. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later that day, BMW issued a recall for several different classes of vehicle, gradually adding more to the list by the end of the day. BMW North America is currently the only automobile manufacturer to have issued a recall relating to these defective Takata NADI inflators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recommending that owners do not currently drive their vehicles, BMW is sending interim notices about the risk to owners until January 17, and again when the remedy becomes available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will inspect the cars and replace the defective airbags free of charge. Owners were last notified on November 20, 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 74,000 cars were originally part of this recall.

In these cases, water in either the release-switch or an in-line connector resulted in a short circuit, opening the tailgate. An unintended open tailgate could lead to unrestrained cargo falling out into the road, creating a risk for both the driver and others.</p>\n<p>Ford estimates that about 3% of 2017-2019 Super Duty F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks are affected, all of them from Ford&#8217;s Kentucky Assembly Plant.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>On October 12, 2018 NHTSA opened a Preliminary Evaluation following reports of unintended tailgate opening on a 2017 model year vehicle. The Evaluation found five cases of the issue, as well as two similar reports made to Transport Canada.</p>\n<p>Ford began its own in-depth investigation and responded to NHTSA&#8217;s Information Request on December 20, 2018. As a part of their investigation, Ford analyzed field data, as well as employee vehicles. The company decided that the issue was not an unreasonable safety risk , due to the low rate of reports and several cases where the tailgate opening had turned out to be caused by a driver inadvertently using properly functioning features. Further monitoring found more instances of short circuiting caused by water damage.</p>\n<p>On November 25, 2019, Ford approved field action.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Ford plans to notify owners of the affected vehicles by mail and has notified dealers. Dealers are expected to add jumper pigtails to the tailgate/frame wiring harnesses. The addition should isolate power and ground circuits and prevent short circuiting. Ford will be providing a general reimbursement plan for vehicle owners.</p>\n<p>An updated tailgate release switch and wiring harness jumper were used in 2020 model year production.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"http://www.motorsafety.org\">MotorSafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17715","createdAt":"2019-12-04T10:27:49.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-12-05T00:12:49.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T23:59:47.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-15T13:44:47.000Z","display_date":"December 04, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V864000","recall_date":"December 4, 2019"},"year":2019,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_556384675-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_556384675","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1176,"name":"2017-2019 Ford F-250 recall","slug":"2017-2019-ford-f-250-recall"},{"id":1178,"name":"2017-2019 Ford F-350 recall","slug":"2017-2019-ford-f-350-recall"},{"id":1179,"name":"2017-2019 Ford F-450 recall","slug":"2017-2019-ford-f-450-recall"},{"id":1236,"name":"2017-2019 Ford Superduty recall","slug":"2017-2019-ford-superduty-recall"},{"id":305,"name":"Ford tailgate","slug":"ford-tailgate"}],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":17709,"title":"Mercedes-Benz Recalls Thousands of Cars For Seat Belt Issues","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-thousands-of-cars-for-seat-belt-issues/","status":"publish","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls-thousands-of-cars-for-seat-belt-issues","excerpt":"<p>Eighteen models manufactured by Mercedes-Benz USA are due for recall after the automaker discovered some of the seat belt assemblies do not work properly. </p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; Dec. 3, 2019 &#8211; Eighteen models manufactured by Mercedes-Benz USA are due for recall after the automaker discovered some of the seat belt assemblies do not work. Buckling up is required by law in most states and not wearing one dramatically increases the risk of serious injury in the event of a crash. All told, nearly 26,700 models are included in the Mercedes-Benz seat belt recall.</p>\n<p>MBUSA says it aims to begin notifying operators of the affected automobiles by mail starting on New Year&#8217;s Eve. Those receiving the warnings are asked to have their vehicles checked out by an authorized MBUSA dealer so the problem can be fixed.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>In paperwork available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Mercedes-Benz is <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V788-9505.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">set to recall 29,679 automobiles </a>&#8211; whose model years run between 2018 and 2019 &#8211; because the seat belts in the front seats fail to work. In some cases, the belts may buckle in fine, but the internal detection system may not recognize that this is the case. This may result in future issues, such as if the pretensioner &#8211; which is manipulated by the vehicles&#8217; PRE-SAFE® controls &#8211; is rendered inoperable.</p>\n<p>Although the size of the Mercedes-Benz seat belt recall is fairly small, it involves multiple model types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2019 AMG GT 63</li>\n<li>2019 AMG GT 63 S</li>\n<li>2019 CLS450</li>\n<li>2019 CLS53</li>\n<li>2018-2019 E300</li>\n<li>2018 E400</li>\n<li>2018 E43 AMG</li>\n<li>2019 E450</li>\n<li>2019 E53</li>\n<li>2018-2019 E63 S AMG</li>\n<li>2019 G550</li>\n<li>2019 G63</li>\n<li>2019 GLC300</li>\n<li>2019 GLC350E</li>\n<li>2019 GLC 43 AMG</li>\n<li>2019 GLC63</li>\n<li>2019 GLC53 AMG</li>\n<li>2018-2019 GLC63S AMG</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of the 50 states, 49 require all drivers to buckle up. Most motorists do so, based upon NHTSA&#8217;s most <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/buckle-it-could-save-your-life\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">recently available usage statistics</a>. In 2016, the latest year for verifiable data, 10,428 people died in car crashes where seat belts were left unused. Had they been wearing them, 2,456 of those individuals would likely have survived their injuries.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>This problem <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V788-5370.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">traces back to October 2018</a>. At that time, safety officials at Mercedes-Benz learned of a few incidents in which operators had their seat belts fastened, but the restraint system didn&#8217;t recognize that was the case.</p>\n<p>Because an initial review couldn&#8217;t determine the cause of the glitch, a task force was assigned to investigate. Reviewers determined the most likely origin of the problem had to do with the &#8220;geometrical dimensions&#8221; of the belt buckle itself. The task force also noted that the seat belt buckle housing could also be compromised.</p>\n<p>In the process of working out a solution, Mercedes-Benz was alerted to two other incidents in August 2019 related to seat belt detection by the occupant restraint system, which furthered the potential for a safety recall.</p>\n<p>Mercedes-Benz has announced multiple safety recalls in 2019. In February, it recalled 300,000 vehicles because of defects with air bag deployment. Another air bag-related recall took place in August, only that one involved just 457 models.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Mercedes-Benz has since developed a resolution that can fix the flaw. Motorists who drive one of the aforementioned automobiles are advised to check their mail for a notification, which the automaker will start distributing in December. Operators should bring their vehicle to a dealership so the issue can be fixed by replacing the malfunctioning units. There will be no charge for this repair.</p>\n<p>For more information on the Mercedes-Benz seat belt recall and whether you&#8217;re affected, please visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.

This increases the risk that the rear toe link itself would disconnect while driving, likely resulting in a significant loss of steering control, and thus raising risk of crash or injury.</p>\n<p>The problem arose as a result of an automated tool the company uses in its manufacturing process experiencing wear and tear on the gears, which reduced its ability to properly tighten the fasteners.</p>\n<p>Drivers will be able to detect whether this problem arises in their vehicle by possibly hearing a noise, a change in the steering wheel&#8217;s height, unexpected wear on the tires or changes to how the SUV handles.</p>\n<p>The Ford Expeditions in the recall were produced Sept. 5 and 6, 2019, while the Lincoln Navigators were only produced Sept. 6.</p>\n<p>To date, the company is not aware of any accidents or injuries stemming from the problem.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Sept. 12, less than a week after the vehicles in question were produced, the automaker&#8217;s Critical Concern Review Group learned of concerns about the under-torqued fasteners, after a torque inspector at the company&#8217;s assembly plant reported a potential issue with low torque conditions on both the left- and right-side rear toe link frame attachments. This issue was discovered through a routine examination, and the company promptly reviewed production records to identify affected vehicles.</p>\n<p>Those still remaining at the plant were inspected, and the suspected torque problem was present in all of them. However, records indicated that some of the affected vehicles had already been shipped out.</p>\n<p>Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee approved the recall on Oct. 18.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford notified the owners of affected vehicles by mail and asked them to return to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to check not only the fasteners, but also rear toe alignment and rear tires, fixing or replacing all as necessary. The company will not need to reimburse drivers because everything is covered by warranty.</p>\n<p>Dealers were first notified of the recall Oct. 28, and owners received their notifications between Nov. 11 and 18.</p>\n<p>For additional details about this recall, consumers can contact Ford by phone at 1-866-436-7332, or call the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hotline at 1-888-327-4236.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"http://MotorSafety.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17704","createdAt":"2019-12-02T04:25:50.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-12-02T18:10:50.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T04:02:18.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-14T17:47:18.000Z","display_date":"December 02, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V773000","recall_date":"October 28, 2019"},"year":2019,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Blue-Lincoln-Navigator-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Blue-Lincoln-Navigator","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1218,"name":"2019 Ford Expedition recall","slug":"2019-ford-expedition-recall"},{"id":1219,"name":"2019 Lincoln Navigator recall","slug":"2019-lincoln-navigator-recall"},{"id":1220,"name":"Ford rear toe fastener","slug":"ford-rear-toe-fastener"},{"id":1221,"name":"Lincoln rear toe fastener","slug":"lincoln-rear-toe-fastener"}],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},{"id":26,"name":"Lincoln","slug":"lincoln-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lincoln_RM.png"}]},{"id":17703,"title":"Potential for airbag damage in Hyundai 2020 Palisades prompts recall","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/potential-for-airbag-damage-in-hyundai-2020-palisades-prompts-recall/","status":"publish","slug":"potential-for-airbag-damage-in-hyundai-2020-palisades-prompts-recall","excerpt":"<p>Hyundai plans a voluntary safety recall for over 11,000 2020 Palisade vehicles.

The Side Curtain Airbags fitted in these vehicles were done so using bolts that were &#8220;produced with sharp corners&#8221; on their hexagonal heads, which could perforate or otherwise damage the SCAPs.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>The 2020 Palisade recall came about after HMC discovered a torn SCAP while a New Car Assessment Program crash test was conducted in Korea on July 15, 2019, which prompted the company to reach out to the supplier and conduct a joint investigation into the potential cause of the damage. Internal crash testing was unsuccessful in replicating the tear, although the two organizations concluded based on further review of test results that the SCAB could become damaged &#8220;due to interference with the mounting bolts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the testing, HMC then notified all regional distributors of Palisades equipped with the bolts and conducted its own search of related field information. HMA&#8217;s Technical Committee convened November 1, 2019, where it made the decision to conduct a voluntary recall as a means of addressing the situation. The recall report was submitted to the NHTSA November 7, 2019.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>While bolts produced with rounded (rather than hexagonal) corners were first used in vehicle production on July 2, 2019, HMA intends to begin a recall for the affected vehicles on January 3, 2020 and will notify dealers and owners and ask them to bring their vehicles to a nearby dealer to each have protective covers installed onto the SCAP bolts. The official Hyundai recall number for this incident is 186, while it is filed at the NHTSA under the recall number 19V-802.</p>\n<p>To find out more about product recalls, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">motorsafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17703","createdAt":"2019-12-02T04:22:58.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-12-02T18:07:58.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T06:10:19.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-12T19:55:19.000Z","display_date":"December 02, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V802000","recall_date":"November 7, 2019"},"year":2019,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/white-2020-Hyundai-Palasaide-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"white-2020-Hyundai-Palasaide-1","category":{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1044,"name":"2020 Hyundai Palisades recall","slug":"2020-hyundai-palisades-recall"},{"id":1045,"name":"Hyundai airbag issue","slug":"hyundai-airbag-issue"}],"categories":[{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"}]}]
