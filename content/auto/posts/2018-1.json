Two Ford Ranger owners <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/01/11/ford-issues-safety-recall-in-north-america-for-certain-2006-ford.html\">have been killed</a> in crashes involving the defective Takata air bag inflators, the second of which occurred this past July, according to the car company. As a result, Ford has advised owners to discontinue operating their vehicles.</p>\n<p>In May 2015, Ford <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2015/RCLRPT-15V322-3873.PDF\">recalled more than 361,000 vehicles</a> after Takata notified the NHTSA of an impending safety action surrounding its passenger-side air bag inflator models, documents submitted to the government agency showed. The Ford recall involved 2004-2006 Ranger pickup trucks produced between March 24, 2003 and May 4, 2006. Ford began replacing the Takata inflators in with stopgap parts in July 2015.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, Ford launched another recall involving the same vehicles due to the development of <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V788-2659.PDF\">permanent repair components</a>, which did not contain phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate propellant, according to the NHTSA. Ford sent notification letters to owners Dec. 12 and began the inflator replacement process. Approximately 11 days later, the automaker received an accident report detailing a fatal crash that had occurred in West Virginia July 1. The tragic incident involved a 2006 Ford Ranger with Takata driver-side air bag inflators that had ruptured upon deployment. This was confirmed during a physical inspection of the vehicle Dec. 27.</p>\n<p>Takata engineers reviewed the ruptured air bag inflators and found that others from the same production population had been involved in an accident in 2006. The belonged to a propellant lot that had not appeared in previous recalls.</p>\n<p>Ford reviewed its production records and narrowed down the vehicles that included inflators from the same lot. On January 8, 2018, the Ford Field Review Committee decided to launch a voluntary recall to address the dangerous parts. The car manufacturer recalled 3,902 vehicles worldwide &#8211; 2,712 in the U.S. market and 190 in the Canadian market.</p>\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n<p>The automaker has directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCAK-18V023-8888.pdf\">replace the front air bag inflators</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgement document from the NHTSA. Ford notified dealers of the recall on Jan. 10 and contacted owners on Jan. 16 via first-class mail.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n<p>Over 2,700 vehicles were originally part of this recall.

That, in turn, could lead inflators to rupture and potentially explode in the event of a crash during which the frontal passenger air bag is deployed. This issue is related to the broader Takata air bag recall.</p>\n<p>In the event the inflator were to cause the air bag to rupture and potentially explode, metal fragments could launch into vehicles&#8217; cabins, which could result in serious industry or death. This issue would likely arise only after several years of exposure to the adverse conditions described above, per Takata testing of the faulty air bags. The likelihood of a rupture could, however, increase due to a number of other factors.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it would be impossible for owners to determine whether their vehicles are likely to be affected by this issue, or if their air bags had already ruptured.</p>\n<p>As part of the Takata recall, three &#8220;zones&#8221; were set up to describe regions where affected vehicles were sold or registered. In this case, A6 Avants and Sedans, as well as S6 Sedans &#8211; all from the 2010 and 2011 model years in Zone B. So too were, certain 2011 A6 Avants and Sedans and S6 Sedans.</p>\n<p>As for vehicles in Zone C, recalled vehicles include model year 2009 A4 and S4 Cabriolets, A6 Avants and Sedans, S6 Sedans, as well as model year 2010 and 2011 A6 Avants and Sedans, and S6 Sedans.</p>\n<p>This filing was made in early January 2018 at the request of the NHTSA, as part of a Coordinated Remedy Order.</p>\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n<p>Drivers who own the affected vehicles will be notified by mail about the issue, and asked to take their cars to authorized Audi dealers to have their frontal air bag inflators replaced at no cost. Due to the size of the Takata air bag recall, Volkswagen is working with the NHTSA to stagger its announcement and planning of the recall efforts as part of the coordinated remedy program.</p>\n<p>As such, owners and dealers alike will officially receive notification of the recall on or around March 3, 2018.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n<p>Over 10,000 vehicles were originally part of this recall.

Per an NHTSA <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V824-1708.pdf\">recall acknowledgment document</a>, the campaign affects numerous models across multiple brands, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2018 Chrysler Pacifica&nbsp;minivans.</li>\n<li>2014-2016 Chrysler Town and Country minivans.</li>\n<li>2007 Dodge Caliber sedans.</li>\n<li>2009 Dodge Challenger sports cars.</li>\n<li>2017 Dodge Charger sports cars.</li>\n<li>2015-2016 Dodge Dart sedans.</li>\n<li>2004 Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles.</li>\n<li>2014-2016 Dodge Caravan minivans.</li>\n<li>2014 Dodge Journey&nbsp;sport utility vehicles.</li>\n<li>2014-2016 Jeep Cherokee&nbsp;sport utility vehicles.</li>\n<li>2017 Jeep Compass&nbsp;sport utility vehicles.</li>\n<li>2011 Jeep Patriot&nbsp;sport utility vehicles.</li>\n<li>2012 and 2015 Ram 1500 pickup trucks.</li>\n<li>2013-2018 Ram 2500&nbsp;pickup trucks.</li>\n<li>2012-2018 Ram 3500, 4500 and 5500&nbsp;pickup trucks.</li>\n<li>2014-2017 Ram Promaster and Promaster City&nbsp;pickup trucks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FCA believes 100 percent of the vehicles named in the action contain the defective parts.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The models referenced in the action come equipped with miniature fire extinguishers prone to clogging or breakage due to defective lever and valve assemblies. These items pose a serious threat to owners, especially those involved in accidents where gasoline ignition is likely to occur. That said, FCA has yet to receive reports linking the defective components to any injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Nov. 3, 2017, the FCA&nbsp;Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance group learned that fire extinguishers supplied by&nbsp;Walter Kidde Portable Equipment were defective. The FCA Global Regulatory Compliance compared the items to a roster of Kidde fire extinguishers involved in an earlier U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recall and found multiple matches. The automotive conglomerate then retrieved samples of the defective products and sent them to specialists at FCA U.S. Engineering and&nbsp;Mopar, an FCA-owned autoparts&nbsp;organization.</p>\n<p>Between Nov. 6 and Nov. 8, analysts at Mopar reviewed the parts and found that production teams were installing them in multiple models across a number of brands. At the same time, the VSRC group launched an investigation into the parts and began evaluating the vehicle populations containing them. On Nov. 10, FCA initiated a yard hold in an effort to stop the production and shipment of vehicles equipped with the Kidde fire extinguishers. Ten days later, an investigator with the VSRC group started combing through historical parts and production information with timestamps dating back to 1973.&nbsp; Over the next three weeks, employees for FCA U.S. Engineering, Mopar and the VSRC group reviewed individual part identification codes and associated vehicle identification numbers to understand the breadth of the impact of the defect.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 18, the FCA Vehicle Regulations Committee decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA intends to swap the defective fire extinguishers installed in affected vehicles for new models with metal valves that prevent clogging. The automotive company plans to notify both dealers and owners Feb. 2, 2018. individuals in need of more immediate assistance can contact Chrysler customer service at (855) 271-0773. Callers should use the internal recall identification code T82.

Ford Motor Company, which had long partnered with Mazda to create B Series pickup trucks, reviewed the supplier&#8217;s submission to the NHTSA and determined that an immediate safety recall was necessary. Mazda engineers agreed with the assessment and initiated a joint recall action with Ford involving nearly 20,000 2004-2006 B Series pickup trucks. Between September 2015 and October 2017, the Japanese automaker replaced the air bag inflators found in recalled vehicles with temporary like-for-like components.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, Mazda informed the NHTSA that permanent replacement parts were available and launched two separate follow-up actions.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 2, Ford received a report detailing a fatal accident involving a 2006 Ford Ranger pickup truck &#8211; the vehicle off of which the B Series model is based &#8211; equipped with Takata air bag inflators. The American automotive company reviewed production records with officials from Takata and found that Mazda had installed the same problematic inflators in some of its B Series trucks.

That, in turn, could lead to an increased risk of accident or injury.</p>\n<p>All 307 of the Giulia sedans in the recall are expected to carry this defect, and were produced from Nov. 14 to Nov. 23, 2017.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>The brake fluid in affected vehicles were limited to the 10-day period in question, before and after which point the contaminated barrels of oil were not present in the factory where the vehicles were put together.</p>\n<p>When the brake system is affected by the contaminated fluid, its components will likely be damaged and lead to a decline in overall performance of the vehicle&#8217;s braking capabilities. There would be no way for drivers to determine that this was happening, and could therefore result in a crash before the problem could be addressed, unless there was a brake failure during operation. In that case, a warning light in the dashboard would come on to alert the driver about the issue. However, the recall report called this warning &#8220;limited.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Two vehicles being tested as part of a Customer Product Audit failed a routine examination on Nov. 23 when they suffered a loss of clutch pressure. This prompted a small population of vehicles to be put on hold. On Nov. 28, Alfa Romeo officially opened an investigation into the issue, and conducted further lab analysis on the vehicles that failed the audits. This analysis found the contamination of the brake and clutch fluid that led to the recall, and determined through internal records that they had both been manufactured at a time when a pallet of brake and clutch fluid, as well as oil, had been used starting Nov. 13. The next day, all vehicles at the plant were held and tested for oil contamination.</p>\n<p>Alfa Romeo was able to create a bypass to only use uncontaminated barrels in further production starting Dec. 5.</p>\n<p>Then, on Dec. 13, FCA Italy finally decided to issue the formal safety recall.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>FCA is encouraging owners to get their vehicles&#8217; brake systems inspected and replaced as necessary, as part of the recall. It will fully reimburse owners who incurred any associated costs with repairing the issues.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the automaker asks that owners send original receipts or other proof of payment to confirm the cost of the expense.</p>\n<p>Fiat Chrysler will notify owners and dealers about the recall starting on or around Feb. 8, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=13216","createdAt":"2018-01-18T07:24:33.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-01-18T21:09:33.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-06T00:16:07.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-11-06T14:01:07.000Z","display_date":"January 18, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"17V-823","recall_date":"December 20, 2017"},"year":2018,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Alfa-Romeo-Giulia-Veloce-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Alfa-Romeo-Giulia-Veloce","category":{"id":155,"name":"Alfa Romeo","slug":"alfa-romeo-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Alfa_Romeo_Logo_aik2tk.png"},"tags":[{"id":1831,"name":"2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia recall","slug":"2018-alfa-romeo-giulia-recall"},{"id":1834,"name":"Alfa Romeo brake fluid defect","slug":"alfa-romeo-brake-fluid-defect"}],"categories":[{"id":155,"name":"Alfa Romeo","slug":"alfa-romeo-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Alfa_Romeo_Logo_aik2tk.png"}]},{"id":13235,"title":"Toyota Recalling Many Vehicles for Incorrect Load Labeling","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/toyota-recalling-many-vehicles-incorrect-load-labeling/","status":"publish","slug":"toyota-recalling-many-vehicles-incorrect-load-labeling","excerpt":"<p>Toyota Motor Engineering &#038; Manufacturing recently issued a recall of nearly 650 vehicles across a number of its most popular models.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plano, Texas &#8211; Jan. 18, 2018 &#8211; Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing recently issued a recall of nearly 650 vehicles across a number of its most popular models&nbsp;over concerns that a software error led to incorrect information being printed on capacity labels, according to a filing made with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>The recall includes the following types of Toyota vehicles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4Runner light SUVs produced in the 2017 and 2018 model years, produced from July 11 to Oct. 6, 2017.</li>\n<li>Highlander SUVs from the 2018 model year produced between Oct. 24 and 26, 2017.</li>\n<li>RAV4 light SUVs from the 2018 model year produced from Sept. 11 to 25, 2017.</li>\n<li>Sienna minivans from the 2017 model year, produced on Oct. 12, 2017.</li>\n<li>Tacoma trucks from the 2017 model year, produced from July 11 to Nov. 2, 2017.</li>\n<li>Tundra trucks from the 2017 and 2018 model years, produced from July 11 to Nov. 4, 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recall also includes Lexus GX460 SUVs from the 2018 model year, produced from Aug. 9 to Oct. 20, 2017.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Due to the programming error, which led to incorrect accessory weight calculations, labels about the vehicles&#8217; load-carrying capacities were printed with the incorrect information.

The campaign affects Mercedes-Benz G 550 and G 550 4&#215;4 sport utility vehicles produced between April 3, 2017, and May 31, 2017. The automaker is unsure what percentage of the referenced models actually contain the defective parts.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles could contain braking systems with defective brake booster vacuum hoses that were not produced to meet design specifications and are prone to collapse as a result. These fixtures may feature hose layers that suffer delamination over time and are therefore likely to deteriorate entirely, leading to brake booster failure. In such scenarios, drivers must exert considerably more effort when depressing the brake pedal. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of a collision. However, Mercedes-Benz has yet to receive any reports connecting the defective brake booster vacuum hoses to accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In August 2017, Daimler AG, the international conglomerate that oversees the Mercedes-Benz brand, received a field report detailing an instance of brake booster failure. One month later, the automaker launched an internal investigation in collaboration with multiple suppliers. The parties involved reviewed production records and field reports, and requested parts for examination. Investigators quickly determined that the vacuum hose mentioned in the initial field report came from a particular batch produced by the German supplier&nbsp;ContiTech Schlauch GmbH over the course of a single day.</p>\n<p>In October, DAG began working with ContiTech to understand the events that led to the production of the defective hose and its identical cousins. Engineers for the parts supplier eventually discovered that an instance of production line maintenance had resulted in widespread oil contamination and the sullying of existing product. By the end of November, DAG and ContiTech had ascertained the extent of the impact of the defective parts via logistics data.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 18, 2017, officials for DAG determined that owner safety was at risk and called for a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>DAG intends to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V817-5227.pdf\">replace the defective vacuum hoses</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document. The automaker plans to notify both dealers and owners this month. However, vehicle service requests are not scheduled to begin until February when replacement parts are expected to become available.

That said, Mercedes-Benz and its parent company, Daimler AG, have yet to receive reports connecting the problematic features to any collisions or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In November 2016, engineers at an American Mercedes-Benz assembly plant discovered recently&nbsp;constructed vehicles with incorrect illumination distribution readings. DAG quality assurance personnel immediately launched an inquiry, performing additional tests and collecting the resulting data for analysis. The investigation team ultimately reviewed information dating from the beginning of production to November 2016.</p>\n<p>DAG ended the inquiry in mid-2017, concluding that headlamp adjustment equipment in the assembly plant had been configured incorrectly and caused the defect. The automotive conglomerate launched two additional investigations to explore the breadth of the problem. Engineers working on the first initiative found that the problem affected only GLC-class vehicles, while the team managing the second inquiry established that the defective lighting features reduced driver field of vision but did not create glare issues when used with oncoming traffic present.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, DAG wrapped up these investigations, confirmed that the defective fixtures violated FMVSS 108 and launched a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Mercedes-Benz will direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V819-7544.pdf\">adjust the headlamps</a> on affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document.

The campaign affects 2018 Ford Mustang coupes produced between March 14, 2017, and Nov. 26, 2017. Ford speculates 100 percent of the models named in the action come equipped with the defective features.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Vehicles referenced in the recall likely include instrument clusters that may not function properly after drivers have moved them from the key-on to key-off position. Specifically, owners have found that, upon engine shutoff, the instrument cluster fails to display the gear selection menu or initiate the warning chime that is supposed to occur when the driver&#8217;s side door has been opened. Additionally, many have seen their vehicles enter&nbsp;sleep mode and automatically initiate park, all without generating a notification. This poses a serious hazard to owners and pedestrians, as the likelihood of vehicle rollaway increases.</p>\n<p>The defective instrument clusters also <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V814-5173.pdf\">violate Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards</a> 102 and 114, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document. The first standard requires manufacturers to produce display clusters that display <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2017-title49-vol6/xml/CFR-2017-title49-vol6.xml#seqnum571.206\">the correct gear position</a> when &#8220;the ignition is in a position where the transmission can be shifted or the transmission is not in park,&#8221; according to the Government Publishing Office. FMVSS 114 applies to theft protection and rollaway prevention technology, and stipulates that all vehicles include ignition systems that prevent &#8220;normal activation of the vehicle&#8217;s engine or motor; and either steering, or forward self-mobility&#8221; when the key is removed.</p>\n<p>Ford has yet to receive any reports connecting the defective instrument clusters to accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In early November 2017, engineers at the Ford assembly plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, discovered a 2018 Ford Mustang that failed to display the gear selection menu and initiate the driver&#8217;s side door warning post engine shutoff. Members of the company&#8217;s&nbsp;Critical Concern Review Group evaluated an internal report outlining the problem on Nov. 22 and called for an engineering inquiry. Investigators found that a software error within the internal power supply voltage measurement component had caused the glitch, which put the vehicle in violation of the FMVSS.</p>\n<p>Engineering personnel introduced amended software Nov. 27 to prevent additional vehicles from coming off the line with problematic programming.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 11, the Ford&nbsp;Field Review Committee evaluated these findings and decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall. The automaker notified dealers between Dec. 18 and Dec. 22.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford has directed dealers to update the instrument cluster software in affected vehicles free of charge. The organization intends to notify owners via first-class mail between Feb. 5, 2018, and Feb. 9, 2018. Those in need of more immediate assistance can speak with Ford customer service personnel by calling (866) 436-7332 and using the internal recall identification code 17C21.

Daimler AG, the automotive conglomerate overseeing the Mercedes-Benz brand, launched an internal investigation immediately after this discovery, requesting operations personnel to collaborate with the German door latch supplier&nbsp;Kiekert AG to determine the root cause. One month later, the team came upon the answer: faulty riveting parameters at the Kiekert production facility in&nbsp;Heiligenhaus.</p>\n<p>Over the next few months, DAG personnel and employees at the parts supplier reviewed production records to determine how many vehicles had come off the line equipped with defective rear door locks. The automaker simultaneously amended its production processes to ensure that other new vehicles would not enter the market with potentially unsafe features. Vehicles produced after June 21, 2017, include new-and-improved door latch assemblies that function properly.</p>\n<p>In September, engineers at DAG performed internal tests to gauge the likely affects of the defective components. In December, the company found that the components violated FMVSS 206 and decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Mercedes is expected to notify dealers and owners this month. However, the needed replacement parts will only be ready by February. Individuals with vehicles named in this action who require more immediate assistance are encouraged to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V816-9863.pdf\">contact Mercedes customer service</a> at (877) 496-3961, according to a NHTSA recall acknowledgment document.

In certain situations, the shifter can move the transmission out of &#8220;park&#8221; without a key in the ignition or the brake pedal being applied, which can lead to rollaways and, potentially, vehicle crashes or injuries.</p>\n<p>The recall affects nearly 1.483 million Ram trucks, though only 3 percent are expected to carry this defect. The first vehicle group includes model year 2016 and 2017 Rams 3500 cab chassis with a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 10,000 pounds. These vehicles were produced from April 22, 2015.</p>\n<p>The second group is model years 2011 to 2017 Ram 4500 and 5500 cab chassis, produced starting on Feb. 3, 2010. The third includes Ram 1500s from the model years 2009 to 2017, produced beginning on May 28, 2008. The fourth includes model years 2010 to 2017 Ram 2500s produced starting Aug. 31, 2009. The fifth includes Ram 3500s from model years 2010 to 2017, produced beginning Sept. 1, 2009. The sixth and final group includes Ram 3500 cab chassis from model years 2011 to 2017, manufactured starting on Feb. 3, 2010.</p>\n<p>All affected vehicles had production end dates of Dec. 31, 2016, but there is a lack of field input beyond that date.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The issue arises when the vehicle is running and in park, and the brake pedal is depressed. This energizes the vehicle&#8217;s&nbsp;brake transmission shift interlock. When the BTSI is energized for too long, it can overheat, causing its housing plastic to grow in size and the grease around it to degrade. That, in turn, could lead to the system&#8217;s locking pin to be stuck in the on position. When that happens, the vehicle can be shifted out of park without the brake pedal being depressed again or a key&nbsp;in the ignition.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this defect would not be in any way detectable for consumers.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Beginning&nbsp;March 3, 2017, FCA&#8217;s Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V821-8697.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opened an investigation</a> into the defect stemming from a 2016 model year Ram with a column shifter being involved in a rollaway incident that led to driver injury.</p>\n<p>A few months later, in May, the organization began searching for customer complaints related to the column shifters in Ram trucks&nbsp;and began further reviewing warranty part return data in June. It was then that the potential cause of the defect &#8211; the BTSI locking pin &#8211; was first suspected.</p>\n<p>On June 22, the VSRC was made aware of a test fleet of 240 Ram trucks, in which 72 were able to move the shifter out of park upon replicating the above conditions. Over the next several months &#8211; from June to December &#8211; the organization visited with suppliers, tested parts and conducted field surveys to determine the scope of the issue.</p>\n<p>Finally, on Dec. 18, 2017, FCA determined that it would need to conduct a voluntary safety recall of all affected vehicles.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The fix for the defect is currently being developed by FCA, but the company will reimburse owners for the cost of repairing the issue when applicable. It asks that owners provide the receipts for the service so they can be reimbursed in full.</p>\n<p>FCA will begin contacting both Ram owners and dealers about the recall Feb. 8, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=13036","createdAt":"2018-01-09T05:20:55.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-01-09T19:05:55.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T23:34:58.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T13:19:58.000Z","display_date":"January 09, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2018,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dodge-RAM-Rebel-768x513.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Dodge-RAM-Rebel","category":{"id":9,"name":"RAM","slug":"ram-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RAM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":9,"name":"RAM","slug":"ram-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RAM.png"}]},{"id":13030,"title":"Dodge Recalls Dakota Pickups With Faulty Seat Warmers","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/dodge-recalls-dakota-pickups-faulty-seat-warmers/","status":"publish","slug":"dodge-recalls-dakota-pickups-faulty-seat-warmers","excerpt":"<p>Chrysler recently issued a recall of 16,900 Dodge Dakota pickup trucks from the 2005 model year.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auburn Hills, Michigan &#8211; Jan. 8, 2018 &#8211; Chrysler recently issued a recall of <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V820-5331.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">16,900 Dodge Dakota pickup trucks</a> from the 2005 model year, citing concerns that the driver or passenger seat warmers installed in some trucks may overheat, according to a defect filing made with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the overheating issue could present itself in both front seats of the vehicle, in either the seat cushion itself, or the seat back. The risk presents itself because of &#8220;fatigue failure&#8221; &#8211; that is, long-term regular use of the warmers &#8211; within the carbon elements of the seat warmers themselves. These can lead to specific spots where the warmers overheat and potentially burn holes in the seat cushions or even result in open flames within the vehicle.</p>\n<p>All vehicles in the recall were manufactured between May 17, 2004, and June 24, 2005. Only about 10 percent of the trucks being recalled are expected to carry this defect.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>If the &#8220;hot spots&#8221; present themselves in a seat cushion&#8217;s heating element, it could lead to a high resistance electrical connection that generates heat beyond what would normally be expected. Unfortunately, the seat cushion control system in the Dakota pickups would not be able to detect the hot spots and therefore cannot automatically shut down the heating component.</p>\n<p>Because of the risk of burning through the seats and starting fires, owners will likely notice extreme heat or burning smells as a result of the defect, as well as potential holes in the seat cushions or seat backs themselves. This risk can result in injury or fire in the vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Sept. 13, 2017, reports of issues with seat heaters in the 2005 Dakotas led Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to convene its U.S. Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization to open an investigation into the problem.</p>\n<p>In the week of Sept. 25, the organization reviewed designs with the company&#8217;s engineering team. About a month later, the two FCA groups met with the supplier of the heated seat carbon element pad to go over the design parameters of the parts in question.</p>\n<p>Then from October to November, FCA conducted a test of the heated seat systems in question, to compare with other such systems, and determined that in the affected Dakotas, the system used to operate the seat heaters was unique from similar systems.</p>\n<p>In late November, the VSRC and engineering teams did a more thorough design review of the heating system in affected trucks and found that they do not have automatic-off settings after the seat heaters have been used for a certain amount of time, potentially allowing them to stay on indefinitely. In early December, the teams were able to reproduce failures in laboratory settings.</p>\n<p>The voluntary safety recall order was finally made Dec. 18, 2017.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Chrysler&#8217;s recall plan will ask owners to bring in their 2005 Dakotas for repair, to enhance the seating systems with updated control features.</p>\n<p>In addition, the company will also reimburse owners who have paid out of pocket to have these issues addressed on their own, as long as they can provide proof of payment to confirm the amount they paid.</p>\n<p>FCA dealers were first notified of the recall Dec. 20, 2017, while owners will receive their notifications beginning on Feb. 8, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=13030","createdAt":"2018-01-08T08:25:43.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-01-08T22:10:43.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T23:35:34.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T13:20:34.000Z","display_date":"January 08, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2018,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2002-Dodge-Dakota-Quad-Cab-768x389.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"2002-Dodge-Dakota-Quad-Cab","category":{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"}]},{"id":13032,"title":"Honda Recalling Fury Motorcycles For Leaking Fuel Tanks","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/honda-recalling-fury-motorcycles-leaking-fuel-tanks/","status":"publish","slug":"honda-recalling-fury-motorcycles-leaking-fuel-tanks","excerpt":"<p>The American Honda Motor Co. recently announced a recall of 20 of its 2010, 2016 and 2017 model year Honda Fury motorcycles.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Torrance, California &#8211; Jan. 8, 2018 &#8211; The American Honda Motor Co. recently announced a recall of 20 of its <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V805-4727.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2010, 2016 and 2017 model year Honda Fury motorcycles</a>, due to concerns that some of their fuel tanks could leak, according to a defect report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>These fuel tanks could have come with the motorcycles as manufactured, or have been installed as replacement parts. These fuel tank parts went through &#8220;an improper manufacturing process&#8221; that could lead to a risk of fuel leakage.</p>\n<p>There are only 20 such vehicles in the recall, of which only three are expected to have this defect. However, given the gravity of the risk involved, this could still be a significant issue for vehicle owners.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The motorcycles listed in this small recall were determined based on sales records for parts, as the issue revolves around replacement parts for 2010 and 2016 bikes. For the 2017 models, the recall was for motorcycles that had the defective fuel tanks as original equipment.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the manufacturing process in question did not provide the necessary welds around a bracket that holds the fuel tanks in place. As a consequence, natural road and engine vibrations could lead the tank to separate from the bracket, and potentially result in a fuel leak.</p>\n<p>This increases the risk of fire because any leaked fuel in the presence of an ignition source may be set aflame, increasing risk of injury or damage to the vehicle.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Sept. 22, 2017, Honda learned of the first occurrence of a fuel leak in the market, and another such issue&nbsp;arose slightly more than a month later on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>As a result, Honda launched an investigation into the cause of the leaks, spanning from November into December. That investigation found that a single day of fuel tank production saw a hiccup in the proper manufacturing process that led some tanks made that day to pass the final welding stage for stay brackets on affected tanks. As a result, they have a structural weakness which others do not possess.</p>\n<p>The decision to push forward a formal recall was made Dec. 12, 2017, and as of that date, the company had already received two warranty claims for the defect.
