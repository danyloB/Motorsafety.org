This inflator recall is one in a series of many airbag deployment issues resulting in multiple recalls.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The estimated total of affected vehicles is 20,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Defect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>20,000 1998-2000 Montero Mitsubishi vehicles are under recall due to airbag deployment issues. In the event of a crash or emergency airbag deployment, the airbag inflator may rupture and send hazardous metal fragments towards the driver. Airbag inflators have also been known to deflate and not provide proper protection to the driver in the event of a crash. Both could risk serious injury to the vehicle driver and other occupants.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected airbag inflators are installed with Non-Azide Driver air bag inflators (NADI) and were not equipped with phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant. High or long term exposure to humidity or excess absorbed moisture may cause the inflators to underinflate or rupture and send hazardous materials towards the vehicles interior. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This official recall is still under development according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Owners should expect to be notified by Mitsubishi once the official recall begins &#8211; which is March 22, 2020. All owners suspecting that their vehicle is under recall are welcome to call MMNA customer service at 1-888-648-7820.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this and other recalls, visit www.motorsafety.org.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#00649e;font-size:12px\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>About MotorSafety.org</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">MotorSafety.org is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to vehicle safety and assisting consumers with the identification and resolution of vehicle manufacturing recalls and defects.

Of the recalled vehicles about 3% are expected to have the faulty transmission. If the transmission shifter cable separates the vehicle could experience problems with gear shifting. The driver of the vehicle may also notice that the transmission will read that it is in a different gear than the transmission has been set in, leading to a vehicle being put in park but still in drive or neutral gear. This could lead to injury both to vehicle occupants and those outside of the vehicle. Certain warning messages will display on the dash of the vehicle if the driver’s side door is opened and the transmission is not in park. Drivers will also find that the transmission is easier to shift if the shifter cable is separated. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) there are zero reported field reports of issues and no crashes or injuries. Fiat-Chrysler has reported approximately 545 warranty claims. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiat-Chrysler has claimed that the solution to the issue would be to install a new shifter cable at no charge. Any Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, or Fiat dealer will perform this repair. If customers have paid for the repair they will be reimbursed. Customers and vehicle owners will be informed about the recall by Fiat-Chrysler in May 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected vehicle owners who suspecting that this recall applies to their vehicle are asked to bring their van into any authorized Ram dealership or to call Fiat-Chrysler customer service at 1 (800) 334-9200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this and other recalls, visit www.motorsafety.org.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"color:#00649e;font-size:12px\" class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>About MotorSafety.org</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">MotorSafety.org is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to vehicle safety and assisting consumers with the identification and resolution of vehicle manufacturing recalls and defects.

Certain airbag inflators were equipped with Non-Azide driver airbag inflators (NADI) that were not installed with phase stabilized ammonium (PSAN) propellant. These affected NADI inflators can absorb excess moisture over long periods of vehicle use. This excess moisture as well as long term exposure to high temperatures can cause inflators to de-inflate or explode without warning, sending dangerous items into the vehicles interior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All affected vehicle owners will be notified by Honda before March 9, 2020. The repair will entail the installation of a replacement driver frontal airbag inflator that does not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant. Unfortunately, dealers do not have access to all parts needed for the full repair. Therefore, a second letter will be mailed to affected vehicle owners once certain replacement parts are available.

A Nissan spokesperson announced that “Nissan Group is implementing the next phase of the Takata inflator recalls in accordance with the predetermined coordinated remedy schedule set by NHTSA.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall outlines that airbag inflators, subjected to high temperatures or humidity, could explode sending propellant and metal objects toward the driver and other occupants. This could result in injury or death. NHTSA estimated that sixteen people in the U.S. have been killed and 250 have been injured due to the defective airbag inflators. Of the recalled vehicles, NHTSA estimates that 25 percent, or 13 million vehicles, are still to be repaired by Nissan. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected owners should take their vehicle into any authorized Nissan or Infiniti dealership to replace the defective airbag inflator, free of charge. Nissan will notify the owners on February 10, 2020 asking to bring their vehicles into any authorized dealers for proper service. Affected vehicle owners should contact Infiniti customer service at 888-810-3715 or Nissan customer service at 888-737-9511, for further recall information. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 300,000 vehicles were originally part of this recall. As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 103,241 airbags had been replaced. To see if your car still needs to be repaired, use MotorSafety’s<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"> free lookup tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#00649e;font-size:12px\"><strong>About MotorSafety.org</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:12px\">MotorSafety.org is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to vehicle safety and assisting consumers with the identification and resolution of vehicle manufacturing recalls and defects.

Affected vehicles may have front brake components, including the brake discs, calipers and pads, that have different dimensions than what was specified for the vehicle. The issue falls under the category of Light Vehicle Brake Systems.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>Affected vehicles were manufactured with a front braking system that has smaller dimensions than what was specified for S560 and S450 vehicles. The issue occurred as a result of inaccurate documentation at a production facility. According to Mercedes Benz, the defect poses no imminent safety harm and the smaller braking system still meets federal standards. However, incorrectly sized brake components may lead to incorrect replacement parts being used during vehicle brake repairs. This could create potential safety problems in the future, including an increased likelihood of crashing.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>In June, 2019, Mercedes Benz USA&#8217;s After Sales Division received a field report from a workshop located outside of the U.S., notifying them of a possible variance between the dimensions of a vehicle&#8217;s braking system and its intended specifications. Further investigation by Mercedes Benz determined the cause of the issue. An affected population was established through production records. In September 2019, the company determined that braking systems with smaller dimensions had also been installed in other models.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, Mercedes Benz began testing the smaller braking systems to make sure that they could operate safely in the affected vehicles. While Mercedes Benz concluded that the error did not result in any violations of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, the company was concerned about potential non-compliance with local legal requirements.</p>\n<p>On December 13, 2019, Mercedes Benz USA decided to conduct a voluntary recall.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Affected owners can have their vehicle&#8217;s front axle brake system replaced by a certified Mercedes Benz dealer. Components that will need to be replaced include the TS Brake pads, both the left and right Brake Caliper and both the left and right Brake Discs. Mercedes Benz USA does not plan to pre-notice reimbursement to owners because all of the replacements are covered by Mercedes Benz&#8217;s new vehicle warranty.</p>\n<p>The issue was replaced in production on May 16, 2018. Vehicles produced after that date will be free of the defect.

Many of these vehicles have sliding roof panels that have become less adhesive, leaving the panel at risk of detaching from the vehicle and causing injury.</p>\n<p>The estimated number of affected vehicles is 744,852, although as few as 2% of those vehicles may have the defect.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to Mercedes Benz, the bonding between the roof glass panel and the sliding roof frame may have deteriorated, resulting in the glass panel coming detached in extreme circumstances. The issue mostly occurred in the production of some vehicles from January 16, 2006 to August 21, 2006. A review by the components supplier, Webasto Roof and Components SE, revealed a change of production methods starting August 22, 2006. As a result, vehicles using components that were manufactured from that day forward are believed to be free of the defect.</p>\n<p>The list of potentially impacted vehicles is long and includes the C32, C55, C320, C230, C240, C280, C350, CLS63, CLS500, CLS550, CLK320, CLK500, E55, E63, E280, E300, E320, E350, E450, E500, E550 lines across several model years.</p>\n<p>The exact cause of the issue remains unclear.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>In December 2017, Mercedes Benz began performing initial investigations of the sliding roof panel on certain model years after a series of isolated field reports from outside the U.S. No damage or injuries had been reported as a part of these field reports. The panels that were involved in each field report were retrieved and analyzed by Mercedes Benz, as well as Webasto Roof and Components SE, and an outside laboratory. These tests came back with inconclusive results.</p>\n<p>To continue research, Mercedes Benz searched the global used car market for more sliding roof panels, since none of the affected models were still in production at Mercedes Benz facilities. In November, 2018, three sliding panels were procured and tested. One of those panels was defective due to the lack of cohesion.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Affected owners can bring their vehicles into a certified Mercedes Benz dealer to have their glass panel bonding checked, free of charge. In situations where a dealer finds that the bonding has become less adhesive, they will replace the entire sliding roof panel. Components that will need to be replaced include the sliding sunroof, front blinds, blind on glass and trim.</p>\n<p>If owners have already taken their vehicle in for repairs on this issue previous to the recall, they may be eligible for a reimbursement from Mercedes Benz. Requests for reimbursement should include information about the parts, labor, fees and taxes. Reimbursements are capped off at the amount that the repair would have cost if it were performed by a certified Mercedes Benz dealer.</p>\n<p>As a part of the recall, Mercedes Benz will be required to submit six consecutive quarterly status reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with the first report due within 30 days of the end of the quarter. In addition, given the extensive length of time between the production of the first defective vehicle and the first field report, Mercedes Benz will be required by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop a plan for vehicles that are currently not defective may be become so in the future.</p>\n<p>Mercedes Benz dealers were notified of the voluntary recall on December 27, 2019. The company plans to notify affected owners on February 14, 2020.</p>\n<p>For more information on this and other recalls, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.motorsafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17749","createdAt":"2020-01-10T04:05:34.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-10T17:50:34.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-13T06:12:10.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-13T19:57:10.000Z","display_date":"January 10, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V918000","recall_date":"December 20, 2019"},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1626502561-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1626502561","category":{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1140,"name":"2001-2005 MERCEDES BENZ C240 recall","slug":"2001-2005-mercedes-benz-c240-recall"},{"id":1144,"name":"2001-2005 MERCEDES BENZ C320 recall","slug":"2001-2005-mercedes-benz-c320-recall"},{"id":1142,"name":"2002-2004 MERCEDES BENZ C32 recall","slug":"2002-2004-mercedes-benz-c32-recall"},{"id":1147,"name":"2003-2005 MERCEDES BENZ CLK320 recall","slug":"2003-2005-mercedes-benz-clk320-recall"},{"id":1150,"name":"2003-2005 MERCEDES BENZ CLK55 recall","slug":"2003-2005-mercedes-benz-clk55-recall"},{"id":1149,"name":"2003-2006 MERCEDES BENZ CLK500 recall","slug":"2003-2006-mercedes-benz-clk500-recall"},{"id":1158,"name":"2003-2006 MERCEDES BENZ E500 recall","slug":"2003-2006-mercedes-benz-e500-recall"},{"id":1159,"name":"2003-2006 MERCEDES BENZ E55 recall","slug":"2003-2006-mercedes-benz-e55-recall"},{"id":1136,"name":"2003-2007 MERCEDES BENZ C230 recall","slug":"2003-2007-mercedes-benz-c230-recall"},{"id":1156,"name":"2003-2009 MERCEDES BENZ E320 recall","slug":"2003-2009-mercedes-benz-e320-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"}]},{"id":17757,"title":"Nissan Recalls a Variety of Vehicles Due to Issue With Replacement Airbag","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/nissan-recalls-a-variety-of-vehicles-due-to-issue-with-replacement-airbag/","status":"publish","slug":"nissan-recalls-a-variety-of-vehicles-due-to-issue-with-replacement-airbag","excerpt":"<p>Nissan/Infiniti recalls several vehicles from a number of years, due to issues with replacement airbag parts equipped as part of a previous recall.</p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; Jan 9, 2020 &#8211; Nissan North America, Inc. (Nissan) is <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V008-5320.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalling over 300,000 vehicles</a> that may be equipped with non-desiccated frontal airbag inflators used as temporary remedy replacement parts for a previous recall. The inflators are in danger of rupturing due to exposure to high levels of humidity or temperatures, as well as rapid temperature changes. The recall includes the following models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2001-2003 Nissan Maxima</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2002-2006 Nissan Sentra</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2002-2004 Nissan Pathfinder</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2007-2011 Nissan Versa Sedan </strong></li>\n<li><strong>2007-2011 Nissan Versa Hatchback</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2001-2004 Infiniti I30 </strong></li>\n<li><strong>2001-2005 Infiniti I35</strong></li>\n<li><strong> 2002-2003 Infiniti QX4</strong></li>\n<li><strong> 2003-2008 Infiniti FX35</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2003-2008 Infiniti FX45</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2006-2010 Infiniti M35</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2006-2010 Infiniti M45</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>Non-desiccated air bag inflators were equipped on various Nissan vehicles as temporary stopgap remedies in previous Takata airbag recalls. These inflators have a defect of their own; due to the presence of moisture in these parts, the inflator&#8217;s supply of stabilized ammonium nitrate is susceptible to changes in pressure. These pressure changes can occur due to high temperatures or high levels of humidity &#8211; in addition, rapid temperature cycling can also cause these pressure changes. At high enough temperatures or humidity, the inflators can explode, resulting in metal debris impacting the driver and passengers in the vehicle. This increases the risk of personal injury to occupants as well as collisions resulting from either distraction or incapacitating injuries.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>In early January, Takata sent out Defect Report 20E-001, detailing a defect they discovered in some airbag inflators used as temporary replacement parts in a recall. Upon receipt of this report, Nissan collated a list of previously recalled vehicles equipped with this remedy. It was determined that 2001-2003 Maxima, 2002-2006 Sentra, 2002-2004 Pathfinder, 2007-2011 Versa Sedan and Versa Hatchback, 2001-2004 Infiniti I30 and I35, 2002-2003 Inifiniti QX4, 2003-2008 Infiniti FX35 and FX45 and 2006-2010 M35 / M45 vehicles were equipped with these replacement parts.</p>\n<p>After the confirming the risk, Nissan drafted a safety recall January 2, 2020, brought upon by an &#8220;abundance of caution&#8221; according to the initial filing. On January 9, this recall notice became public, and owners of the affected vehicles were made aware of the risk. Preparations were made to replace the non-desiccated inflators with correct desiccated ones; the remedy process is projected to start in early February.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>In accordance with the initial recall, Nissan will notify owners of the danger and replace the air bag inflators with non defective ones, free of charge. Owners will be periodically notified and reminded of the defective nature of the parts and the recall will be distinguished from the original to avoid confusion. Owners can bring their vehicles to authorized retailers in order to receive their free replacement parts. However, until then, owners are advised not to operate their vehicles due to the risk involved to both occupants and other motorists. This recall is expected to begin February 10, 2020.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n<p>Over 300,000 vehicles were originally part of this recall. <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 103,241 airbags had been replaced.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:14595,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:10}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=Concatenate(&quot;As of &quot;,R[0]C[4],&quot; – the last date information was available – &quot;,R[0]C[11],&quot; airbags had been replaced.&quot;)\">As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 103,241 airbags had been replaced.</span><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021, 958,175 airbags had been replaced, with 400,346 remaining.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:769,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\"> </span>To see if your car still needs to be repaired, use MotorSafety’s<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"> free lookup tool</a>.</p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17757","createdAt":"2020-01-09T14:44:27.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-10T04:29:27.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-23T08:01:53.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-06-23T21:46:53.000Z","display_date":"January 09, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"20V008000","recall_date":"January 9, 2020","meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","custom_schema":""},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1780836008-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1780836008","category":{"id":40,"name":"Infiniti","slug":"infiniti","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/infiniti_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1116,"name":"2001-2004 Infiniti I30 recall","slug":"2001-2004-infiniti-i30-recall"},{"id":1117,"name":"2001-2004 Infiniti I35 recall","slug":"2001-2004-infiniti-i35-recall"},{"id":1118,"name":"2002-2003 Infiniti QX4 recall","slug":"2002-2003-infiniti-qx4-recall"},{"id":1168,"name":"2002-2004 Pathfinder recall","slug":"2002-2004-pathfinder-recall"},{"id":1167,"name":"2002-2006 Sentra recall","slug":"2002-2006-sentra-recall"},{"id":1119,"name":"2003-2008 Infiniti FX35 recall","slug":"2003-2008-infiniti-fx35-recall"},{"id":1120,"name":"2003-2008 Infiniti FX45 recall","slug":"2003-2008-infiniti-fx45-recall"},{"id":1121,"name":"2006-2010 Infiniti M35 recall","slug":"2006-2010-infiniti-m35-recall"},{"id":1170,"name":"2006-2010 Infiniti M45 recall","slug":"2006-2010-infiniti-m45-recall"},{"id":1169,"name":"2007-2011 Versa recall","slug":"2007-2011-versa-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":40,"name":"Infiniti","slug":"infiniti","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/infiniti_RM.png"},{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"}]},{"id":17727,"title":"BMW Vehicles may Unexpectedly Shift into Neutral","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-vehicles-may-unexpectedly-shift-into-neutral/","status":"publish","slug":"bmw-vehicles-may-unexpectedly-shift-into-neutral","excerpt":"<p>BMW has reported that some M8s may unexpectedly shift into neutral gear because of a problem with the transmission wiring harness. </p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; December 20, 2019</em> &#8211; BMW of North America LLC is <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V883-9052.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"recalling (opens in a new tab)\">recalling</a> certain 2017-2019 2019-2020 M8 Gran Coupe, M8 Coupe, and M8 Convertible vehicles.

In some cases, these sparks can interact with exhaust gas and cause the vehicle&#8217;s carpet or carpet insulation in the B-pillar area to catch on fire.The defect is unique to the 2017-2019 model year, as those vehicles were built with unique seat belt pretensioners. All vehicles assembled after October 29, 2019 were modified to prevent the issue.</p>\n<p>So far there has been one report in the U.S. of a fire caused by the seat belt pretensioner.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>In September 2018, Ford did some testing on the B-pillar area of their Super Duty vehicles, after a similar issue was reported in the 2015-2018 F-150 model. At that time, Ford did not determine that the area was at risk of combustion. In October 2019, Ford received a report from NHTSA of a post-crash fire in the B-pillar area of a 2019 F-250 Crew Cab. Both Ford and NHTSA inspected the vehicle and Ford performed analysis on related parts. Ford also performed nearly 300 vehicle level tests, finding issues in a few cases. Further inspection found that variance in the profile of the carpet edge was a determinate on whether the carpet combusted. While the investigation was still ongoing, Ford began adding heat resistant foil tape to all 2019 model year vehicles.</p>\n<p>On December 4, 2019 Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee reviewed the situation and approved field action.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail and told to take their vehicles to a certified Ford or Lincoln dealer for repairs. Dealers will apply heat resistant foil tape to the carpet and carpet insulation edges in affected vehicles and modify the sound deadener on the back of the B-pillar trim panel.</p>\n<p>Dealers will be notified of the recall beginning December 12, 2019, while owners will be notified from January 20, 2020 to January 24, 2020.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17726","createdAt":"2020-01-06T08:03:09.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-06T21:48:09.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-13T23:12:53.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-14T12:57:53.000Z","display_date":"January 06, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V880000","recall_date":"December 19, 2019"},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Brown-2020-Ford-Superduty-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Brown-2020-Ford-Superduty","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1176,"name":"2017-2019 Ford F-250 recall","slug":"2017-2019-ford-f-250-recall"},{"id":1178,"name":"2017-2019 Ford F-350 recall","slug":"2017-2019-ford-f-350-recall"},{"id":1179,"name":"2017-2019 Ford F-450 recall","slug":"2017-2019-ford-f-450-recall"},{"id":1181,"name":"Ford fire risk","slug":"ford-fire-risk"},{"id":1180,"name":"Ford seat pretensioner recall","slug":"ford-seat-pretensioner-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":17725,"title":"Excess glue caused problems in GM trucks","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/excess-glue-caused-problems-in-gm-trucks/","status":"publish","slug":"excess-glue-caused-problems-in-gm-trucks","excerpt":"<p>General Motors LLC recalls Silverado and Sierra 1500 pickups with an excess of glue by the B+ battery positive cable rings which may cause an intermittent connection.</p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; Dec. 20, 2019 &#8211; General Motors LLC <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCONL-19V888-1590.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is recalling</a> certain 2019-2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 trucks.

A bad connection could cause the vehicle stall and also cause arcing, which could generate enough heat to start a fire. The defect was caused by an excess of glue that should have been removed from around the B+ battery cable rings during the supplier&#8217;s assembly process. The excess glue resulted in glue contamination.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>General Motors&#8217; Canadian Brand Quality Manage found a case where a 2019 GMC Sierra stalled because it was missing the nut that secures the B+ cable to the alternator stud. On August 20, 2019, the Brand Quality Manager submitted a report to General Motors&#8217; Speak Up For Safety (SUFS) program. GM opened an investigation on September 10, 2019. The investigation found warranty reports of related field incidents. Between September and November, GM experts analyzed parts to determine the cause of the defect and conducted a torque-curve study. Field data analysis was completed November 25, 2019, finding one case of a related fire.</p>\n<p>On December 5, 2019, General Motors&#8217; Safety and Field Action Decision Authority decided to conduct a safety recall.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Owners of affected vehicles will be notified and told to take their vehicles to a certified General Motors dealer for repairs, free of charge. Dealers will use a black light to inspect for glue and other contaminants at the B+ cable attachment alternator. Dealers may clean the connection and then reattach the B+ cable connection. If any damage has occurred to the alternator, cable or nut will replace the damaged parts. Secondary black light inspection has been implemented in production to catch the defect moving forward. Secondary inspections began November 14, 2019 at General Motors&#8217; Fort Wayne plant and November 22, 2019 at their Silao plant.</p>\n<p>Dealers will be notified of the recall beginning on December 12, 2019, while owners will be notified on January 27, 2020.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">motorsafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17725","createdAt":"2020-01-06T08:02:05.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-06T21:47:05.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-06T02:28:12.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-11-06T16:13:12.000Z","display_date":"January 06, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V888000","recall_date":"December 12, 2019"},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1292346829-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1292346829","category":{"id":12,"name":"Chevrolet","slug":"chevrolet-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chevy_ms.png"},"tags":[{"id":1182,"name":"2019-2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 recall","slug":"2019-2020-chevrolet-silverado-1500-recall"},{"id":1183,"name":"2019-2020 GMC Sierra 1500 recall","slug":"2019-2020-gmc-sierra-1500-recall"},{"id":1184,"name":"Chevrolet battery connection issue","slug":"chevrolet-battery-connection-issue"},{"id":1185,"name":"GMC battery connection issue","slug":"gmc-battery-connection-issue"}],"categories":[{"id":12,"name":"Chevrolet","slug":"chevrolet-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chevy_ms.png"},{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"}]},{"id":17724,"title":"General Motors trucks recalled for a software error","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-trucks-recalled-for-a-software-error/","status":"publish","slug":"general-motors-trucks-recalled-for-a-software-error","excerpt":"<p>463,995 General Motors vehicles form Cadillac, GMC and Chevrolet have been recalled because of an issue with their Electronic Brake Control Module.   </p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; Dec. 20, 2019 &#8211; General Motors LLC is<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCONL-19V889-8579.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> recalling</a> certain 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Cadillac CT6, and GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles.

The unexpected deployment of either air&nbsp;bags or seat belt pretensioners may cause injury or a vehicle crash. In addition, the defect may cause increased the risk of&nbsp;an accident because the air&nbsp;bag warning light may not precede an inadvertent deployment of&nbsp;the air&nbsp;bag or the seat belt pretensioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The defect occurred in vehicles that were manufactured from May 18, 2004, when production of the 2005 MY Dodge Viper began, until August 28, 2006, when production ended. FCA used vehicle production records to identify affected vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Timeline Of Events</h3>\n<p>On January 27, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) informed the National Highway Transportation Administration that they would be doing a voluntary recall of certain 2002-2003 Jeep Liberty, 2002-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and 2003-2004 MY Dodge Viper vehicles. Each of the models had an issue with the Occupant Restraint Control, which was replaced in the affected vehicles. On January 28, 2019, an Occupant Restraint Control issue also occurred on a 2005 MY Dodge Viper in the field. The incident involved both passenger and driver air&nbsp;bags deploying without warning or an accident. The incident was reported as a Customer Assistance Inquiry Record (CAIR) by Fiat Chrysler. On October 2, 2019, Chrysler participated in an inspection of the reported vehicle that showed electrical overstress to one of the application specific integrated circuits&nbsp;controlling the air&nbsp;bag squibs, the same issue that occurred in Chrysler&#8217;s 2015 recall.</p>\n<p>On December 5, 2019, Fiat Chrysler US&#8217;s Vehicle Regulations Committee decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall of the affected vehicles. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is aware of one injury that was related to the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is conducting a voluntary safety recall to replace the Occupant Restraint Control in all affected vehicles.The current model of ORC will be replaced with a new one that uses the next generation of electrical architecture and does not have a history of unexpected air&nbsp;bag deployment.</p>\n<p>According to Fiat Chrysler, both dealers and owners will be notified either on or around January 31, 2020. Owners should take their vehicles to a certified Fiat Chrysler dealer. Owners of recalled vehicles&nbsp;can seek reimbursement from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. To ensure a smooth reimbursement process, FCA requests that owners send in either an original receipt or another adequate proof of payment. FCA will make this request formally in their recall letters to owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dealers are required by federal law to complete the recall service on vehicles that are still in the dealer&#8217;s new vehicle inventory. Failure to do so could result in a&nbsp; $21,000 civil penalty for each incomplete vehicle.

The dual- mode locking mechanism is meant to lock the seat belt webbing. The mechanism goes into affect based on feedback from vehicle deceleration (G-sensor) and whether the seat belt webbing is pulled out quickly (webbing sensor). However, during a specific production period, which lasted from August 26, 2019, until October 10, 2019, part supplier Joyson Safety Systems used an improper adjustment while assembling a certain spring that was used in the webbing sensor locking mechanism. The spring may be installed at an incorrect position in certain affected vehicles. An incorrectly positioned spring may interfere with other components in the webbing sensor locking mechanism and cause the mechanism to not lock properly. The G-sensor will not be affected unless the vehicle has been involved in certain types of crashes. As a result of the defect, an occupant may not be restrained properly during a crash, increasing the risk of injury.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toyota estimates that about 4% of vehicles with rear seat belt assemblies with a dual-mode locking mechanism have the defect.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Timeline Of Events</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On August 28, 2019, a Toyota plant team member found that a webbing sensor locking mechanism for the rear seat belt on a vehicle that was in production did not activate. The possible defect was reported to Joyson Safety Systems, who launched their own investigation. This investigation determined the cause of the defect. A review by Joyson Safety Systems of their production history also identified other recent assemblies that contained similar issues. The next day, August 29, 2019, Joyson Safety Systems was able to adjust the compression pin that was being used for the defective springs to a proper position. Further review found that the problem may have been created by an adjustment on August 19, 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On December 5, 2019, Toyota decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall campaign for the affected vehicles.

Each dealer will be tasked with inspecting the production date of the vehicle&#8217;s rear seat belt assemblies to determine if the vehicle is affected. If the vehicle contains the defect, dealers will replace the seat belt assembly with a new one that was produced correctly. Notifications to dealers were sent on December 10, 2019.

As a result, the affected vehicles are not in compliance with S6.2.1 and S62.2, which states that rearview images will not be displayed after the end of the &#8220;backing event.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A &#8220;backing event&#8221; is <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/811024.pdf\">defined by NHTSA</a> as &#8220;an amount of time which starts when the vehicle&#8217;s direction selector is placed in reverse and ends… when the vehicle forward motion reaches a continuous duration of 10 seconds.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the defect, affected vehicles&#8217; rearview images may stay until the drive cycle ends, which can be longer than 10 seconds. An extended rearview image display may distract the driver and possibly cause a vehicle crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, 100% of Pacifica vehicles that feature a 8.4&#8243; radio display, 360-degree surround view camera system and seat back video screens carry the defect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Timeline of</strong> <strong>events</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 12, 2019, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles&#8217; US Engineering Department notified the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization of a potential issue with rearview image display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2019, the Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization confirmed the defect. Soon after, Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance determined the scope of vehicles that were potentially affected by the condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 5, 2019, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US, based on information from the Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization, decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall of the affected vehicles. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will be conducting a voluntary safety recall that will most likely begin during the First Quarter of 2020. Owners can bring their recalled vehicles into a certified Fiat Chrysler dealer, who will be charged with flashing the suspect radios with updated software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updated radio software should be able to return to its normal function after a &#8220;backing event.&#8221; Although the date is not determined, the recall will most likely begin January 31, 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All affected customers will be reimbursed for the cost of repairs. Fiat Chrysler US is requesting that the owners of recalled vehicles send in their original receipt or other proof of payment as a form of confirmation. This process will allow the company to keep a consistent record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"http://www.motorsafety.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.</p>\n<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script>","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17728","createdAt":"2020-01-06T07:53:32.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-06T21:38:32.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T00:44:44.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-14T14:29:44.000Z","display_date":"January 06, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V886000","recall_date":"December 12, 2019"},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/White-Chrylser-Pacifica-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"White-Chrylser-Pacifica","category":{"id":20,"name":"Chrysler","slug":"chrysler-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrysler_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1203,"name":"2018-2019 Chrysler Pacifica recall","slug":"2018-2019-chrysler-pacifica-recall"},{"id":1204,"name":"Chrysler Pacifica surround view camera issue","slug":"chrysler-pacifica-surround-view-camera-issue"}],"categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Chrysler","slug":"chrysler-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrysler_RM.png"}]},{"id":17721,"title":"Mercedes Benz Airbags in Need of Update","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-airbags-in-need-of-update/","status":"publish","slug":"mercedes-benz-airbags-in-need-of-update","excerpt":"<p>Mercedes Benz cars are being recalled because they have outdated airbags and related software.

Each of the affected vehicles was not updated by the Vehicle Processing Center before being released to the public, as is protocol. Due to the defect, drivers will not receive advanced warning when their airbags are deployed. A faulty driver air bag and software version can cause the vehicle&#8217;s restraint systems to not work during a crash, creating a greater risk of injury.</p>\n<p>Mercedes Benz notes that vehicles outside of the recall population are fully equipped with the correct equipment and software.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Mercedes Benz developed the initial airbag modules for the new model year in September, 2018 and production of all of the affected vehicles occurred between June 20, 2018 and February 5, 2019. These early production vehicles were supposed to be updated after that time. A routine plant audit determined that the affected vehicles were released without an update. In the case of each affected model, Mercedes Benz was able to determine the recall population through production records.</p>\n<p>Mercedes Benz decided to conduct a safety recall on November 29, 2019. The company submitted paperwork to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on December 6, 2019.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Mercedes Benz will notify both owners and dealers of the defect. Dealers will be notified December 13, 2019, while owners will be notified February 4, 2020. The recall is voluntary for owners. Authorized Mercedes Benz dealers will replace customers&#8217; air bags and upgrade the software so that it is certified for the 2019 model year. Because the affected vehicles are a newer model, all upgrades will be covered by warranty.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MotorSafety.org</a>.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17721","createdAt":"2020-01-06T07:46:30.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-06T21:31:30.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T00:57:32.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-14T14:42:32.000Z","display_date":"January 06, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V868000","recall_date":"December 6, 2019"},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-Mercedes-Benz-E53-AMG-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"2019-Mercedes-Benz-E53-AMG","category":{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1206,"name":"2019 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG recall","slug":"2019-mercedes-benz-e63-amg-recall"},{"id":1207,"name":"Mercedes-Benz airbag recall","slug":"mercedes-benz-airbag-recall"},{"id":961,"name":"Mercedes-Benz software recall","slug":"mercedes-benz-software-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"}]},{"id":17722,"title":"Mercedes Benz Recalls a Single 2020 GLE450 4MATIC Vehicle Over Issue with Third Row Headrests","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-a-single-2020-gle450-4matic-vehicle-over-issue-with-third-row-headrests/","status":"publish","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls-a-single-2020-gle450-4matic-vehicle-over-issue-with-third-row-headrests","excerpt":"<p>Due to an issue with incorrectly manufactured third-row seating headrests, Mercedes Benz USA LLC is recalling one 2020 GLE450 4MATIC vehicle</p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; Dec. 18, 2019 &#8211; Mercedes Benz USA LLC is <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V867-4682.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalling one</a> 2020 GLE450 4MATIC vehicle.

These issues affect the adjusting of the headrest and the level of comfort, and may increase the risk of injury for occupants.</p>\n<p>There is only one unit that is believed to be affected by this issue.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The headrest issue involves one 2020 GLE450 4MATIC vehicle. This vehicle possesses third row headrests that did not meet intended manufacturing standards. These headrests are proportioned incorrectly and possess adjustment rods that do not function as intended. This affects the comfort of passengers sitting in these seats. More importantly, the headrest may not properly protect passengers in the event of automotive collisions. This increases the risk of injury and death.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On December 6, 2019, Mercedes Benz USA LLC, was made aware of an issue regarding incorrectly manufactured third row headrests. The vehicle affected by this issue was identified through production records; it was determined that the defect is limited to one vehicle in the recall population; a single GLE450 4MATIC vehicle. On December 17, Mercedes Benz released a public recall notice with the NHSTA, describing the issue and announcing a planned remedy process. The recall is expected to begin February 4 of next year.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Mercedes Benz USA LLC will notify the owner of the identified vehicle. An authorized Mercedes Benz dealer will replace the defective third row headsets at no cost to the owner. The recall is expected to begin February 4, 2020; in the event of changes or new information, the owner will be informed. The company has not publicly released any special instructions regarding the ownership and operation of the vehicle in the meantime. Presumably, it would be advisable to not operate the vehicle in question with occupants in the third row of seats.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">MotorSafety.org.</a><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17722","createdAt":"2020-01-06T07:41:30.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-06T21:26:30.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:37:22.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-14T17:22:22.000Z","display_date":"January 06, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V867000","recall_date":"December 6, 2019"},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1279395082-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1279395082","category":{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1208,"name":"2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 recall","slug":"2019-mercedes-benz-gle450-recall"},{"id":1209,"name":"Mercedes-Benz head rest","slug":"mercedes-benz-head-rest"}],"categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"}]},{"id":17718,"title":"Subaru Recalls Certain 2019 Crosstrek, Forester, and Ascent vehicles ","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/subaru-recalls-certain-2019-crosstrek-forester-and-ascent-vehicles/","status":"publish","slug":"subaru-recalls-certain-2019-crosstrek-forester-and-ascent-vehicles","excerpt":"<p>Subaru of America, Inc recalls some 2019 Crosstrek, Forester, and Ascent vehicles for a defective Positive Crankcase Ventilation valve that may flood the engine.  </p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; Dec. 12, 2019 &#8211; Subaru of America, Inc. is <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCONL-19V856-9802.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalling</a> certain 2019 Crosstrek, Forester, and Ascent vehicles.

Subaru recommends that owners do not operate their vehicles. Owners will be notified when repair and removal services become available for this specific issue. Dealers will review and train in the provided remedy procedures, and inspect any vehicles brought in under suspicion of possessing the defective valves. If a Subaru vehicle is found to possess this defect, it will be repaired. When the recall starts for already sold vehicles, vehicle owners will receive these repairs free of charge. Replacement and repair of these devices should only be undertaken by professional repairmen.</p>\n<p>For more information on this or other recalls past or present, visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">MotorSafety.org.</a><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=17718","createdAt":"2020-01-06T05:46:56.000Z","date_gmt":"2020-01-06T19:31:56.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:43:52.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-14T17:28:52.000Z","display_date":"January 06, 2020","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V856000","recall_date":"December 12, 2019"},"year":2020,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1787643788-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1787643788","category":{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"},"tags":[{"id":1212,"name":"2019 Subaru Ascent recall","slug":"2019-subaru-ascent-recall"},{"id":1210,"name":"2019 Subaru Crosstrek recall","slug":"2019-subaru-crosstrek-recall"},{"id":1211,"name":"2019 Subaru Forester recall","slug":"2019-subaru-forester-recall"},{"id":1213,"name":"Subaru PCV issue","slug":"subaru-pcv-issue"}],"categories":[{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"}]},{"id":17719,"title":"Ford Motor Company Recalls Certain 2020 Explorer and Lincoln Aviator Vehicles","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-motor-company-recalls-certain-2020-explorer-and-lincoln-aviator-vehicles/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-motor-company-recalls-certain-2020-explorer-and-lincoln-aviator-vehicles","excerpt":"<p>Ford Motor Company is recalling certain 2020 Explorer and Lincoln Aviator vehicles for issues with the erosion of fuel line casings potentially leaking fuel over time.</p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; Dec. 11, 2019 &#8211; Ford Motor Company <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLQRT-19V864-2436.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is recalling</a> certain 2020 Explorer and Lincoln Aviator vehicles.
