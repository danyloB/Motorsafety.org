Engineers from the German automaker conducted expansive field tests to see if the problem was common among i3 models at other dealerships. On Jan. 17, 2017, BMW personnel reviewed collected diagnostic data and determined that the&nbsp;issue was indeed widespread. Engineers performed further evaluations to better understand how the fuel tank vent line might degrade over time.</p>\n<p>Soon after, BMW surveyed manufacturing records to determine which models might be affected. On Feb. 2, the automaker began the voluntary recall process. Dealers&nbsp;received notification Feb. 10. No vent line-related injuries have been reported.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>\n<p>BMW has ordered all dealers to inspect the fuel tank vent lines in affected models and offer replacements if necessary. Additionally, all recalled i3s are to be outfitted with clips that keep fuel tank vent lines and B+ battery cables separate and prevent chaffing. Dealers will administer the repairs free of charge.

The sensors used in these systems can bend and become damaged over time with repeated passenger contact. In some cases, these devices can malfunction completely and inhibit air&nbsp;bag deployment, even when occupants are present. This presents serious safety risks, as passengers could be left without protection when an accident occurs.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In April 2016, an owner submitted a defect petition requesting that GM investigate the PPS systems in Solstice and Sky models. Roughly one month later, the automaker opened an internal inquiry. The NHTSA made GM aware of additional complaints soon after and, in July, solicited warranty information for potentially vehicles. On Dec.&nbsp;15, GM launched an official investigation. Engineers met with NHTSA officials throughout December and January 2017. The automaker&#8217;s Safety Field Action Decision Authority initiated a recall Jan. 19 and notified dealers Jan. 26.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>GM has not yet developed a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCMN-17V061-8566.pdf\">workable solution</a> to the problem, according to documents filed with the NHTSA. There is no timetable for when a solution might be available but dealers have been advised to address customer concerns. Consequently, the automaker has updated its Global Warranty Management system so dealership personnel can effectively respond to individuals who may own affected vehicles. GM also advises Solstice and Sky owners to contact customer service for additional assistance.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10050","createdAt":"2017-02-21T02:30:54.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-02-21T08:15:54.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-04T10:29:21.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-01-05T00:14:21.000Z","display_date":"February 21, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":"","meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","custom_schema":""},"year":2017,"month":2,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shutterstock_766450546-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_766450546-1","category":{"id":37,"name":"GM","slug":"gm-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gm.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":37,"name":"GM","slug":"gm-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gm.png"},{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"},{"id":23,"name":"Saturn","slug":"saturn-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn_RM.png"}]},{"id":9980,"title":"Lamborghini Recalls Rare Sports Cars Due to Fire Risk","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/lamborghini-recalls-rare-sports-cars-due-fire-risk/","status":"publish","slug":"lamborghini-recalls-rare-sports-cars-due-fire-risk","excerpt":"<p>Lamborghini is recalling almost 1,500 vehicles due to improperly handled fuel vapors.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Bologna, Italy &#8211; Feb. 20, 2017 &#8211;</em> Lamborghini is recalling almost 1,500 vehicles due to improperly handled fuel vapors.

The fuel can then seep into the evaporative emission control system via engine purge valves. Here, the fuel can potentially damage essential EVAC components, allowing improperly treated vapors to circulate and ignite with exhaust gases. This can lead to an engine fire, which poses obvious safety risks for occupants.</p>\n<p>Lamborghini and the NHTSA say this situation is more likely to develop with repeated idle revving. Additionally, vehicles with aftermarket exhaust systems are more susceptible than those with stock components.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>The Italian automaker received several owner complaints in 2015 that detailed instances of irregular idle activity and sudden engine shutoff. Lamborghini technicians investigated the claim and discovered a link between these occurrences and carbon canister saturation.

A patch will reportedly make the door&#8217;s sealing screen more effective, as the vehicle accommodates the proper cable housing.</p>\n<p>The recall affected 846,000 vehicles subject to earlier recalls, and the 2016 recall was meant to replace the earlier efforts as dealers installed more up-to-date hood latches into these vehicles.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=9632","createdAt":"2017-02-07T02:11:53.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-02-07T15:56:53.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T06:37:00.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T20:22:00.000Z","display_date":"February 07, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":2,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shutterstock_100135217-1-768x510.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_100135217-1","category":{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"}]},{"id":9616,"title":"Honda Recalls World&#8217;s Only Air Bag-Equipped Motorcycle","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/honda-recalls-worlds-air-bag-equipped-motorcycle/","status":"publish","slug":"honda-recalls-worlds-air-bag-equipped-motorcycle","excerpt":"<p>Honda will recall its Gold Wing motorcycles due to defective Takata air bags.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Torrance, Calif. &#8211; Feb. 06, 2017 &#8211;</em> Honda is recalling 882 motorcycles equipped with potentially dangerous Takata airbags. The recall affects the Honda Gold Wing motorcycle &#8211; the only motorcycle in the world today equipped with an air bag. The recall covers the following models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2006-2007 Honda GL1800 Gold Wings</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2012 Honda GL1800 Gold Wings</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recall Summary</h2>\n<p>According to documents compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the propellant wafers in some air bag inflators may degrade over time due to excessive heat or humidity. If the air bags are activated, they could do so with excessive force, causing the inflators to rupture and spread shrapnel at the rider. In addition, some defective air bags in automobiles have inflated without warning, causing injury and death. As of this year, 11 deaths and more than 180 injuries have been attributed to <a href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/12/800k-ford-recall-takata-passenger-airbag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">faulty Takata air bags around the world</a>.</p>\n<p>Due to the impact of climate on the air bags, the recall will focus on specific regional zones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All of the above models sold and registered in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Island.</li>\n<li>Model year 2006-2009 motorcycles sold and registered in Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.</li>\n<li>Model year 2006 &#8211; 2008 motorcycles sold and registered in Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Honda previously <a href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2016/06/02/honda-goldwing-takata-airbag-recall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalled 2,701 2006 &#8211; 2010 Gold Wing motorcycles</a> for a similar air bag issue in June 2016. The effort was also largely focused on areas of the U.S. where high heat and humidity was the norm.</p>\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n<p>Honda will notify all motorcycle owners of the recall, and dealers will replace the air bag module, free of charge. The recall will occur in phases, based on risk levels. Those manufactured between 2006 and 2010 will be recalled first, while the rest will be handled next. If customers have already chosen to have a dealer deactivate the air bag while they wait for replacement parts, it is important for them to determine that the module has indeed been completely turned off before getting a replacement. This can be done by disconnecting the negative battery terminal and checking the fuse plate.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n<p>Over 800 vehicles were originally part of this recall. <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 24, 2018, – the last date for which information was available – 434 airbags had been replaced.&quot;}\"

announced that it would have to recall some of its buses in response to a defect that may lead to sudden, accidental&nbsp;brake engagement.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Defect</strong></h3>\n<p>ARBOC will recall model year 2015-2016 ARBOC&nbsp;Spirit of Liberty buses manufactured between Nov. 7, 2014 and July 29, 2016. According to documents compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the parking brake on these vehicles can engage if the&nbsp;doors are opened at any speed. If the door happens to open accidentally, this could cause the bus to suddenly slow down and stop. It is believed that an electrical flaw in the system caused the two functions to connect.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Oct. 10, 2016 &#8211; The manufacturer received a notice that a driver had experienced a sudden parking brake activation&nbsp;when the entry door was opened. This notice was then sent to dealers.</li>\n<li>Dec. 6, 2016 &#8211; A Freightliner repair shop told the manufacturer that a bus had come into the shop after its parking brake failed while driving at highway speeds. The bus had not been fixed yet, and at the time the repair was considered optional. However, the high-speed failure led the manufacturer to consider a full recall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\n<p>All dealers will notify affected&nbsp;customers, the process of&nbsp;which may take up to two weeks to complete. Once this is done, vehicle owners will be able to bring their buses in to dealers, who will make adjustments to the parking&nbsp;brake. Owners will then be able to file warranty claims with the manufacturer.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=9598","createdAt":"2017-02-02T03:38:03.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-02-02T09:23:03.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T06:41:40.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T20:26:40.000Z","display_date":"February 02, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":2,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shutterstock_1288978-1-768x511.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1288978-1","category":null,"tags":[],"categories":[]}]
