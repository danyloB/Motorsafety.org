This issue was originally noticed by the GMC itself, that reported it to the regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in June 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its report, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/02/12/2020-02729/general-motors-llc-receipt-of-petition-for-decision-of-inconsequential-noncompliance\" target=\"_blank\">the manufacturer asked NHTSA to consider the defect “inconsequential</a>&#8221; given that the reflections from the lights would appear “high above the vehicle… outside the driver view,” among other reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, on March 4, NHTSA<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2022-04540.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> rejected GM&#8217;s petition.</a> As a result, GM will have to recall these vehicles to rectify the problem.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headlights that are too bright can cause glare, which may temporarily blind drivers of oncoming and surrounding vehicles. This can cause a crash, which increases the risk of an injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other GMC Terrain recalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=16V502000\" target=\"_blank\">The last 2012 GMC Terrain recall was in July 2016 due to the risk of rollaway.</a> Similarly, the last 2013 GMC Terrain recall also dates back to 2016, when over 360,000 of these cars were recalled due to faulty windshield wipers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-recalls-gmc-terrain-and-chevy-equinox-suvs-over-loss-of-vehicle-control/\" target=\"_blank\">2020-2021 Terrain SUVs were among vehicles recalled due to tire tread separation that could result in the driver losing control of the vehicle</a>, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GM said that it would fix the problem by replacing the faulty headlights.
