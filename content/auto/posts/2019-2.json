This is part of a vast and ongoing scheduled recall of vehicles with Takata airbags.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Herndon, VA – February 28, 2019</em> – Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) is recalling over 100,000 vehicles equipped with Takata airbags that could explode and injure vehicle occupants. The recall includes the following models: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2017 Audi R8</li><li>2016-2017 Audi TT</li><li>2015-2017 Volkswagen CC</li><li>2015-2016 Volkswagen Eos</li><li>2015 Volkswagen Passat</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of a vast and ongoing scheduled recall of vehicles with Takata air bags. The estimated number of units affected is 119,394.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The defect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V014-1192.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">NHTSA Safety Report</a> filed January 11, the non-desiccated ammonium nitrate used as a propellant in the air bag inflators in the passenger side airbags of these vehicles poses a risk at some point in the future for all vehicles thus equipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the driver&#8217;s frontal air bag deploys, the defective inflator could potentially rupture. The degrading ammonium nitrate present in the propellant wafers may explode under excessive internal pressure in the event of a crash which causes deployment of the driver&#8217;s frontal air bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In very rare cases, the explosion might mean that metal fragments could pass through the air bag cushion material and go flying into the interior of the vehicle from the passenger front side, potentially striking the vehicle occupants and conceivably resulting in serious injury or death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall is part of a massive worldwide recall of vehicles with Takata airbags that is being conducted in waves starting with the vehicles that are at highest risk of propellant degradation (older vehicles and vehicles in Zones 1, 2, and 3.)&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All test ruptures reported by Takata to date have occurred on inflators returned from regions subject to high absolute humidity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeline of events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing was made as required per the NHTSA Coordinated Remedy Order. The date of determination for Audi was January 2, and the date of determination for Volkswagen was January 9, 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen will cooperate with NHTSA to prioritize and stagger vehicle repairs by joining NHTSA&#8217;s coordinated remedy program. The remedy components for this defect are not ammonium-nitrate based accelerant air bag inflators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/takata-airbag-recall-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Consumer Reports</a>, the investigation began in 2008, after reports of exploding air bags and flying metal shrapnel surfaced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cause turned out to be degraded propellant wafers in the air bag inflators manufactured by Takata, which were installed in millions of cars between 2002 and 2015.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicles made by 19 different automakers have been recalled in what may turn out to be the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall is expected to begin in March 2019. Volkswagen will notify owners by mail, and be instructed to take their vehicle to an authorized Audi dealer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will replace the driver&#8217;s frontal air bag inflator with an alternative part, free of charge. Audi and Volkswagen are excluding reimbursement for costs associated with replacement of air bag inflators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Audi recalled component description is 4S0.880.201, and the Volkswagen&#8217;s part numbers are 3C8.880.201 and 561.880.201</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 100,000 vehicles were originally part of this recall. As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 99,216 airbags had been replaced. To see if your car still needs to be repaired, use MotorSafety’s<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"> free lookup tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=16755","createdAt":"2019-02-28T14:08:37.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-03-01T03:53:37.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-23T08:15:25.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-06-23T22:00:25.000Z","display_date":"February 28, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"19V014000","recall_date":"January 11, 2019","meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","custom_schema":""},"year":2019,"month":2,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grey-2018-Audi-R8-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Grey-2018-Audi-R8","category":{"id":16,"name":"Audi","slug":"audi-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/audi_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1538,"name":"2015 Volkswagen Passat recall","slug":"2015-volkswagen-passat-recall"},{"id":1539,"name":"2015-2016 Volkswagen EOS recall","slug":"2015-2016-volkswagen-eos-recall"},{"id":1540,"name":"2015-2017 Audi TT recall","slug":"2015-2017-audi-tt-recall"},{"id":1541,"name":"2017 Audi R8 recall","slug":"2017-audi-r8-recall"},{"id":635,"name":"Takata air bags","slug":"takata-air-bags"},{"id":1393,"name":"Volkswagen airbag recall","slug":"volkswagen-airbag-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":16,"name":"Audi","slug":"audi-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/audi_RM.png"},{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"}]},{"id":16763,"title":"Mercedes-Benz Recalls Nearly 300,000 More 2010-2017 Vehicles for Takata Airbag Defects","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-nearly-300000-more-2010-2017-vehicles-for-takata-airbag-defects/","status":"publish","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls-nearly-300000-more-2010-2017-vehicles-for-takata-airbag-defects","excerpt":"<p>Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) is recalling certain Coupe, Cabrio, 4Matic and RWD vehicles that were sold or every registered in “Zone A”, “Zone B” or “Zone C”, for defective Takata airbags.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Sandy Springs, GA – February 28, 2019 –</em> Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (<span class=\"EFkvDd\">OTCMKTS:</span><span class=\"WuDkNe\">DDAIF</span>) is recalling <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;288,775&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:1},&quot;12&quot;:0}\">288,775</span> vehicles equipped with potentially explosive Takata airbags.

The inflator, if deployed in a degraded state, can explode, with its debris potentially striking any occupants and leading to injury or death.</p>\n<p>The issues with these Takata air bags have been well documented, and this latest Mercedes-Benz announcement is part of a massive worldwide recall of vehicles with Takata air bags, deployed in segments, with vehicles at highest risk being recalled first. The potential for rupture can be affected by climates that are extreme in regard to heat and humidity, particularly in the southern U.S. states and territories.</p>\n<p>Degradation speed may also be affected by other factors, including the specific environment in which a vehicle is kept and operated, the individual inflator and propellant configuration, and manufacturing variability from facility to facility. The common thread is the inflators housed in the Takata airbags and installed in the passenger side of the front of the car.</p>\n<p>While the NHTSA has determined that all Takata air bags with this defect will eventually become dangerous, the defect is not considered high-risk until degradation occurs, which can take years even in climates with temperature cycling and absolute humidity. All manufacturers have agreed to comply with the recall in stages to allow new air bag supplies to be manufactured and distributed to dealers.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Jan. 2, 2019, Takata filed another Defect Information Report with NHTSA according to the previous schedule in the May 4, 2016 Amendment to the Coordinated Remedy Order, announcing a defect in some of the subject inflators. Daimler AG (&#8220;DAG&#8221;), the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, has not been made aware of any confirmed field incidents with the subject Takata PSPI-2 inflators in their vehicles.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, based on the information provided and the long term investigation and subsequent recalls, and out of an abundance of caution, DAG is voluntarily conducting a recall of the vehicles equipped with the subject Takata PSPI-2 inflators in zones A, B, and C in the United States and its territories, in accordance with the 3rd Amendment to the Consent Order and as previously planned in conjunction with Takata and the NHTSA.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Mercedes-Benz is in the process of notifying owners . An <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RIONL-19V010-5403.pdf\">interim letter</a> was mailed between Feb. 1 and March 8, and a second letter will be sent when parts are available. Authorized dealers will then replace the passenger-side front air bag modules in the potentially affected Mercedes-Benz vehicles, at no cost. In the cases of owners who have already addressed this defect by paying out of their own pocket, Mercedes-Benz will provide notice regarding reimbursement to owners in the customer letter.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n<p>Over 288,000 vehicles were originally part of this recall. <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 134,310 airbags had been replaced.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:14595,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:10}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=Concatenate(&quot;As of &quot;,R[0]C[4],&quot; – the last date information was available – &quot;,R[0]C[11],&quot; airbags had been replaced.&quot;)\">As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 134,310 airbags had been replaced.</span><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021, 958,175 airbags had been replaced, with 400,346 remaining.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:769,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\"> </span>To see if your car still needs to be repaired, use MotorSafety’s<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"> free lookup tool</a>.</p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=16763","createdAt":"2019-02-28T14:03:25.000Z","date_gmt":"2019-03-01T03:48:25.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-23T08:28:53.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-06-23T22:13:53.000Z","display_date":"February 28, 2019","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":"","meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","custom_schema":""},"year":2019,"month":2,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shutterstock_1461328175-1-768x487.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1461328175-1","category":{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Mercedes-Benz","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mercedes_RM.png"}]},{"id":16757,"title":"Subaru recalls 370,000 vehicles with dangerous Takata airbags","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/subaru-adds-more-than-370000-vehicles-to-takata-air-bag-recall-list/","status":"publish","slug":"subaru-adds-more-than-370000-vehicles-to-takata-air-bag-recall-list","excerpt":"<p>Subaru of America, Inc. is recalling certain 2010-2013 Forester, 2010-2014 Tribeca, WRX, Outback, Legacy, and 2010-2011 Impreza vehicles sold or registered in hot and humid regions due to potential airbag malfunction. </p>\n","description":"<p><em>Camden, NJ</em> – February 27, 2019 – Subaru (OTCMKTS:FUJHY) is recalling 373,514 vehicles in two recalls related to potentially deadly Takata airbags.</p>\n<p>Both recalls are limited to cars sold or registered in certain states that experience high temperature and humidity.

The injectors are part of full passenger frontal air bag modules which have been utilized over many years as original equipment and replacement equipment. Takata&#8217;s investigation to date has revealed that the propellant wafers can degrade over time, especially when exposed over long periods of time to high absolute humidity and drastic temperature cycling.</p>\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n<p>This degradation can lead to explosive combustion in the event of a crash that triggers deployment of the passenger frontal air bag. Excessive internal pressure when the non-desiccated ammonium nitrate inflator with degraded propellant is activated can cause the inflator to rupture, causing metal fragments to pass through the air bag. As the sharp metal fragments exit the air bag module at high speed, they can enter the vehicle interior and strike the front seat passenger, driver or other occupants of the vehicle, potentially resulting in serious injury or death.</p>\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCONL-19V007-1323.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">owner letters</a>, Subaru has warned owners not to allow passengers to ride in the front passenger seat until the defect has been remedied.</p>\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n<p>The recall began January 25, 2019.

Affected vehicles cover units in a range manufactured between 2010 and 2017, from areas determined to be most at risk for propellant degradation. This includes most Southern, Mideastern and Midwestern states (classed as Zones A, B, and C) as well as U.S. territories including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands (Saipan), and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The potential number of units affected is 1,299,448. Vehicles affected may include:</p>\n<p>• 2010-2016 Toyota 4Runner vehicles<br />\n• 2011-2015 Scion xB vehicles<br />\n• 2011-2015 Toyota Sienna vehicles<br />\n• 2010-2014 Lexus IS350C and IS250C vehicles<br />\n• 2011-2015 Lexus IS-F vehicles<br />\n• 2014-2017 Lexus GX460 vehicles<br />\n• 2011-2013 Toyota Corolla vehicles<br />\n• 2011-2013 Corolla Matrix vehicles</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V005-6222.PDF\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Safety Report</a> filed Jan. 9, the subject vehicles all are equipped with front passenger air bag inflators of the Takata PSPI-6 designation. These airbags contain a non-desiccated, phase stabilized ammonium nitrate propellant. It has been determined that propellant degradation is certain to occur at some point in time after prolonged exposure to high absolute humidity or temperature.</p>\n<p>If a non-desiccated ammonium nitrate inflator with degraded propellant is activated during a collision, it may result in a rupture of the inflator, which can subsequently cause metal fragments to pass through the air bag and into the vehicle interior. The high speed deployment of the fragments can cause severe injury or death to vehicle occupants.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Jan. 2, Takata filed Part 573 reports in accordance with terms specified in the May 4, 2016 Amendment to the Nov. 3, 2015 Consent Order between Takata and the NHTSA. Based on Takata&#8217;s Part 573 reports, Toyota decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall about a week later to identify the subject vehicles and replace the air bag inflator or assembly. Toyota has, however, stated that it does not, by this action, fully endorse the content of Takata&#8217;s Part 573 reports.</p>\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RMISC-19V005-7497.pdf\">Toyota&#8217;s defect information report</a>, the automaker is unable to provide an estimate of the percentage of vehicles that are an immediate danger. As noted in the May 2016 Amendment to the Takata Consent Order, the length of time that a non-desiccated frontal Takata PSAN inflator will have reached the point where they pose an unreasonable risk to safety could be quite long and is dependent on the age of the inflator and environmental exposure, among other factors. The recall is being deployed in phases with vehicles deemed most at risk &#8211; as well as those located in hot and humid regions &#8211; being prioritized.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The recall began Feb. 15. By March 10, all known owners of the affected Toyota and Lexus vehicles will have been notified of the recall by first class mail, and instructed to return their vehicles to a Toyota or Lexus dealer, as applicable. Depending on the vehicle model, dealers will either replace the front passenger airbag inflator only, or replace the entire airbag assembly, free of charge. Any vehicle owners who have already paid to fix this condition prior to this campaign may seek reimbursement for their costs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n<p>Nearly 1.3 million vehicles were originally part of this recall. <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021, – the last date for which information was available – 1,060,060 airbags had been replaced.

(The air bag inflators were also used as replacements, so vehicles which have had the air bag replaced may still have a faulty device.)</p>\n<p>If a vehicle which is so equipped is involved in a crash and the front passenger airbag deploys, there is a significant risk of the inflators exploding. This is due to propellant degradation, which typically occurs in response to long-term exposure to weather in hot and humid environments.</p>\n<p>If an inflator explodes out of the front of the airbag, flying pieces of metal can strike passengers and the driver and cause serious injuries or death.</p>\n<p>The Zones designated for the Takata recall are being prioritized as their climate leads to more rapid degradation, and vehicles are being recalled in waves with the oldest makes and models first, do to the higher risk involved for such vehicles and the pace of production for replacement air bags being limited by the sheer number needed to replace all in service.</p>\n<p>On May 3, 2016, an Amendment to the Nov. 3, 2015 Consent Order was filed after the NHTSA evaluated the rate at which propellant degradation may occur in non-desiccated frontal airbag inflators. It was adjudged that there was significant variation based on geographic factors affecting both environmental heat and humidity. The department further concluded that all non-desiccated frontal Takata PSAN inflators will reach a threshold level of degradation at some point, at which time the inflator has a significantly increased risk of becoming unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p>According to previous filings, other than inflators already under recall, Takata is not aware of any test ruptures in ballistic testing or confirmed field incidents related to the subject non-desiccated ammonium nitrate inflators. On Dec. 17, 2018, Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee decided to issue the next phase of this recall to cover vehicles from the priority zones and years covering 2010 to 2014.</p>\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n<p>Owners will be notified by mail with instructions to take their vehicle to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to have their passenger frontal air bag inflator replaced, free of charge, with one that utilizes an inflator without ammonium nitrate.

These non-desiccated propellant filled inflator types may have been original equipment or used as replacements.</p>\n<p>Due to propellant degradation occurring after long-term exposure to absolute humidity and temperature cycling, these inflators can become unstable and may explode in the event of a crash that triggers the deployment of the passenger frontal air bag. In the case of an inflator explosion, sharp metal fragments can fly out of the inflator, striking the driver or other occupants and potentially resulting in serious injury or death.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Based upon Takata DIRs that were filed with the NHTSA Jan. 2, 2019, BMW vehicle assembly records were subsequently reviewed to determine what an appropriate potentially affected vehicle population would be, and made the following determination based on recall component differentiation to non-recall component: The recalled component contains a specific non-desiccated ammonium nitrate as the gas generator but the newer remedy part does not.</p>\n<p>Propellant wafers in some of the subject inflators degrade over time, which could potentially lead to a violent explosion with flying metal shards in the event of air bag deployment. The potential for such an event occurs in some of the subject inflators after several years of exposure to persistent conditions of high absolute humidity or temperature.</p>\n<p>Other factors, such as specific vehicle environment, the inflator and propellant configuration, and manufacturing variability, can also influence the likelihood of an event. Vehicles from southern and coastal areas of the U.S. appear to be more likely to have experienced this degradation. In the face of the latest information from Takata, BMW voluntarily choose to conduct a safety recall to replace the frontal air bags on the affected vehicles. This decision came to pass solely on the basis of information provided by Takata. BMW is unaware of any injuries arising from this issue at the time of the report.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Recall notification to owners is planned to begin and end March 4, 2019. The passenger&#8217;s front air bag module will be replaced. Owners will be notified by first class mail and instructed to take their vehicle to an authorized BMW center to have the remedy performed for free.

That, in turn, might cause metal fragments to pass through the air bag and into the vehicle interior at high speed, potentially injuring or even killing vehicle occupants.</p>\n<h2><strong>Timeline of events</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RMISC-18V021-2383.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chronology</a> submitted to the NHTSA, in June 2014, the department&#8217;s Office of Defects Investigation opened a case based on six inflator rupture incidents involving vehicles produced by five manufacturers. All six cars were operated in Florida or Puerto Rico at the time of the rupture and for the majority of their product lifecycle, and were equipped with Takata inflators. ODI determined that five additional vehicle manufacturers used inflators of a similar design and vintage also supplied by Takata. ODI requested all 10 manufacturers expand the regional recalls for passenger inflators as Takata&#8217;s testing of the passenger inflators to date continued to indicate hot and humid area as having the highest risk, but in light of eight more field incidents, the recall was expanded nationally.</p>\n<p>On May 4, 2016, NHTSA expanded the scope of the original recalls to include additional vehicles built with non-desiccated PSAN air bag inflators. On May 16, 2016, Takata submitted a 573 Defect Information Report to NHTSA stating that the front programmable smokeless passenger inflator and non-desiccated air bag inflator could contain a safety defect. Since most of the inflator ruptures are associated with long-term PSAN propellant degradation (caused by years of exposure to temperature fluctuations and intrusion of moisture present in the ambient atmosphere), recall populations have occurred in segments with the oldest vehicles from hot and humid locations recalled first.</p>\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n<p>Chrysler is issuing a recall on all affected vehicles. The recall began February 4, 2019, and owners should be contacted on or around February 28. Owners who incurred the cost of repairing a problem may send adequate proof of payment to the company for confirmation of the expense and a subsequent refund.

Up to 159,740 units may be affected.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V020-8175.PDF\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, the battery ground fastener on the driver-side front fender may have been improperly secured, possibly resulting in a loss of power steering assist. A loss of power steering could vary the steering effort required, which may contribute to oversteer and understeer conditions. This, in turn, can cause a vehicle to crash without prior warning.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Sept. 18, 2018, the automaker&#8217;s Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance Predictive Analytics group received a field service report regarding 2019 DT vehicles experiencing an intermittent loss of power steering caused by a loose ground fastener.</p>\n<p>During October 2018,&nbsp;VSRC Product Investigations searched field data, warranty and assembly plant processes. An inquiry began Nov. 1, 2018, and between November and December, various Chrysler departments investigated the root cause of the issue and labored to identify risks to customers. Lab testing verified that a loose fastener may cause system voltage diagnostic trouble codes to set in the Electric Power Steering module. As a result of these DTCs, the EPS may shut down, causing failure of the power-steering assist function.</p>\n<p>By Jan. 11, 2019, Chrysler identified approximately 24&nbsp;reports related to this issue, but is unaware of any accidents or injuries. On January 17, 2019, the automaker determined it would be prudent to conduct a voluntary recall of the affected vehicles.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The recall began Feb. 11. Chrysler has notified owners, and dealers who sold the vehicles to their customers will remove the suspect ground fastener, inspect and clean the ground stud and cables as needed, and torque the ground fastener between 18 and 22Nm while ensuring both cables are properly secured. These services will be performed free of charge. Owners who paid to rectify this specific issue themselves may send the original receipt and/or other adequate proof of payment to the company for confirmation of the expense and eventual reimbursement.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Chrysler customer service at 1-800-853-1403.

The recall is due to potential fuel pump issues, and 437,032 units were potentially affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The defect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V060-9010.PDF\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Safety Recall Report</a>&nbsp;on this incident, sodium particulates contained in low-quality fuels can adhere to certain internal components in the fuel pump. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can eventually lead to build-up, which in turn increases the electrical and mechanical resistance inside the pump, and subsequently reduces fuel pump performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a vehicle is operated in surroundings with high ambient temperatures, a reduction in fuel pump performance can restrict vehicle acceleration, cause an engine stall or both. If the engine stalls while the vehicle is moving, the chances of a crash greatly increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeline of events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honda received the first report of an engine stall prior to August 2017. Claims were minimal and infrequent, so Honda made the decision to continue monitoring the market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between August and September 2017, after additional engine stall reports, Honda launched an investigation. Failed return parts were sent to the fuel-pump supplier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was known that the fuel pump operating voltage could vary between 10 V-13 V. The supplier was able to recreate the engine stalling condition while operating the fuel pump in 10 V mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between October and November 2017, sodium deposits were found on the brush and commutator components in the failed fuel pumps, and between December 2017 and June 2018 Honda conducted additional tests, determining that low-quality fuels were to blame for the problematic presence of sodium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recreation tests confirmed that fuel containing greater than one part per million of sodium could result in the aforementioned restriction in regard to safe vehicle acceleration, or potentially result in a stalled engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between July and November 2018, more testing confirmed that when the fuel pump operated in 10 V mode, more sodium could accumulate within it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This situation was found to result in increased mechanical and electrical resistance, and caused a reduction in fuel pump performance. Poor pump performance can lead to an engine stall as well as restricted or rough vehicle acceleration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 22, 2019, Honda determined that a credible defect related to motor vehicle safety existed. The automaker then made the decision to conduct a safety recall, having received 731 warranty claims and 102 field reports but no accounts of any crashes, injuries or deaths directly related to this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RMISC-19V060-9492.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">media release from Honda</a>, all owners of registered vehicles are being contacted by mail. The notice will request that each owner take their vehicle to an authorized Acura or Honda automobile dealer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the car has been brought to the seller, the FI-ECU will be updated with software programming that disallows fuel pump operation in the 10 V range and thus prevents the potential for sodium accumulation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the vehicle owner informs the dealer that they have experienced an engine stall, and this is confirmable via a diagnostic scan, the fuel pump will also be replaced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both services will be completed at no cost to the owner. Additionally, any owners who previously paid to have one, or both repairs, completed out of their own pocket will be eligible for reimbursement.

This may increase the risk of a crash.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Dearborn, MI – February 11, 2019</em> – Ford&nbsp; (NYSE:F) has recalled 1,263,051 F-150 trucks that may suddenly downshift to first gear, possibly causing the driver to lose control of the truck, increasing the risk of a crash. The recall includes <strong>2011-2013 Ford F-150</strong> <strong>trucks</strong> with six-speed automatic transmission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall concerns <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-transit-connect-vans-due-to-engine-fire-risk/\">issues with Ford’s Powertrain Control Module (PCM)</a> which is the car&#8217;s brain, responsible for over 100 elements, including changing gears in an automatic transmission. The module needs information from an Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor to know how fast the car is going, and thus which gear to use. The recalled vehicles may intermittently lose the signal between this sensor and the PCM, potentially resulting in the car unexpectedly shifting into first gear.&nbsp; This may cause it to suddenly slow down or the rear tires to slide or lock, increasing the risk of a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other F-150 recalls and causes&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-more-than-one-million-f-150-trucks-for-transmission-issues/\">Ford recalled several F-150 models with a particular automatic transmission</a>, including the 2011 and 2012 F-150, for the same issue. This action expands that recall to include all 2011-2013 F-150s with six-speed automatic transmission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Various causal factors” may be to blame for the defect, including “contamination, power short to ground, connector corrosion, connector pin swaging, and incorrect outputs from the OSS sensor.” In the previous recall, Ford blamed the problem on a manufacturing error by a molded lead frame supplier which caused the circuit carrying the OSS sensor signal to break.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety concerns and complaints</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudden downshifting may increase the risk of an accident that can hurt the drivers and other people on or off the road.&nbsp; In fact, an <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2017/INCLA-RQ17010-6238.PDF\">investigation into the Ford transmission downshifting issue </a>uncovered 10 crashes and three injuries caused by this defect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 1,000 complaints were logged by the distressed F-150 owners to both NHTSA and Ford and there were&nbsp; “many instances” where the issue caused drivers to swerve out of their lanes or off the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One&nbsp; of them said when the gears changed without warning, &#8220;it [felt] like you got hit from behind, causing you to slam your head and body on the seat.&#8221; Another one said that its 2013 F-150 would lose power, stall or shift on its own, “leaving the truck a wreck waiting to happen at any time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Downshifting in these instances typically happened without warning.

The problem stems from a steering-linkage configuration that can catastrophically fail over time. The recall will ultimately affect more than 660,000 heavy-duty trucks worldwide.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/ram-heavy-duty-trucks-recalled-for-steering-issue/\">Consumer Reports</a>, the linkage that connects the truck&#8217;s steering with its front wheels could separate over time, due to a loose nut. As a result, drivers may experience a loss of steering control. Loss of steering, especially at high speeds, can increase the risk of serious crash and potentially cause injury or even death.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=20605&amp;mid=431\">safety bulletin </a>released by FCA, the recall follows a December 2018 investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into steering failures on some Ram trucks. The inquiry began after the agency received two complaints from owners that the linkage between the steering box and the front wheels can separate. In the FCA&#8217;s press release, the auto manufacturer announced that it is currently aware of one injury and eight crashes that may have been caused, at least in part, by this issue.</p>\n<p>Vehicles recalled include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2014-2017 Ram 2500 pickups</li>\n<li>2013-2017 Ram 3500 pickups</li>\n<li>2013-2017 Ram chassis cab trucks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional vehicles will be subject to recall in Canada (an estimated 62,734 trucks), Mexico (est. 17,682) and certain markets outside the three biggest North American nations (est. 5,837). The NHTSA has not yet provided more details on this recall, or the sequence of events leading to the announcement.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/02/06/steering-failure-650k-chrysler-truck-recall/\">reporting from CBS</a>, customers will be advised regarding when they may schedule service to address the potential linkage issue. FCA doesn&#8217;t have a specific date yet for owners of the affected trucks to be notified, but stated that it will do so before April 2019.</p>\n<p>Dealers will inspect a steering linkage nut: If it&#8217;s properly tightened, it will be welded to a sleeve to keep it in place, and if it&#8217;s loose, the steering assembly will be replaced outright. The replacement or repair of any faulty parts will be completed at no charge to owners. Owners can contact FCA at 1-800-853-1403 to learn more. They can also reach out to the NHTSA Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or go to www.safercar.gov.

The recall is expected to affect roughly 222,000 model-year 2019 Ram 1500 pickups worldwide that are equipped with the adjustable pedals. The 2019 Ram Classic is not affected by this recall.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/ram-trucks-recalled-because-brake-pedal-can-detach/\">Consumer Affairs</a>, affected vehicles have electrically operated adjustable brake pedals to allow drivers of different heights to comfortably position the gas and brake pedals closer to them, or further away from them, depending on their height and leg length. FCA said these Ram brake pedals may detach if drivers adjust them to their rearmost positions. Lack of braking power can potentially lead to a crash, injury and even death.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=20604&amp;mid=431\">safety bulletin</a> released by FCA, an FCA US investigation researched vehicles that have been equipped with the pedal adjustment feature. The adjustment process, which is activated by a switch and operated with an electric motor, is recommended for use only when the vehicle is stationary as it enables a driver to adjust pedal position.</p>\n<p>The investigation found that drivers activating the feature to move pedals to their rear-most position may, in vehicles that have a particular defect in design, cause the integrity of the brake pedal assembly to become compromised which can lead to detachment of the brake pedal.</p>\n<p>Additional vehicles will be subject to recall in Canada (est. 22,111), Mexico (est. 783) and certain regions outside the North American market (est. 5,487). The NHTSA has not yet provided more details on this recall or the sequence of events leading to the announcement.</p>\n<p>FCA US stated that the company is currently unaware of any related injuries or accidents. However, customers affected by this recall are urged to refrain from using the adjustable-pedal feature until their vehicles are serviced, and also to never use the adjustable-pedal feature while driving. More information can be found in owner manuals.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>According to the FCA bulletin, dealers will &#8220;further secure the brake pedal&#8221; at no charge to owners. FCA says it will notify owners of affected trucks. More than 33% of affected vehicles are still at dealerships, and all of those vehicles will be repaired before they are sold. Owners can contact FCA at 800-853-1403. Owners may also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or go to www.safercar.gov.

The recall is expected to affect approximately 14,370 model year 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata sports cars with automatic transmissions manufactured over the four-year range.</span></i></p>\n<h2><b>The Defect</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to</span><a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/mazda-mx-5-miata-recalled-for-transmission-problem/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer Affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a software problem in the transmission can cause an unexpected downshift, which may cause the vehicle to slow abruptly. In affected vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions, electrical noise in the range signal can occur while driving in &#8220;D&#8221; range, including in instances when the vehicle is being operated by the driver in &#8220;Manual&#8221; mode.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This electrical noise may be detected by the clutch control software in the Transmission Control Module (TCM), and, due to inappropriate control logic of the software in question, the signal noise may cause the vehicle to unexpectedly downshift. A downshift mid drive can cause a sudden and rapid deceleration of the drive wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An abrupt decrease in the speed of the drive wheels while driving is hazardous, as it can negatively affect the directional stability of the vehicle. This hazard both increases the risk of a driver losing control of the vehicle which could ultimately lead to a crash and injury or even loss of life.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Timeline of Events</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a</span><a href=\"https://insidemazda.mazdausa.com/press-release/statement-on-safety-recall-of-certain-2016-2019-my-mazda-mx-5-miatas/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mazda statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Mazda North American Operations has therefore filed a Defect and Non-Compliance Information Report with NHTSA regarding a safety concern with certain Model Year (MY) 2016-2019 Mazda MX-5 Miatas.
