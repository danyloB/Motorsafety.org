While the latest expansion includes models from several manufacturers, much of the coverage for this new round centers on the Ferrari recalls.

In a pair of press releases published May 18, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles explained the conditions leading to each recall. Neither of these are connected to any known injuries or accidents, and both of them have repercussions outside of North America, although the majority of vehicles in each case are within the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>The first recall: Clockspring assemblies</strong><br />\nThis action concerns the systems that may prevent some Jeep Wrangler SUVs from deploying their air bags correctly. The statement said that exposure to contaminants could <a href=\"http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=17518&amp;mid=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weaken the clockspring and interfere with the circuit</a> that controls air bag function. Drivers are particularly at risk, since the driver-side air bag is the one that could be disabled through this action.</p>\n<p>The SUVs featured in this recall have model years between 2007 and 2010, with an estimated&nbsp;392,464 of these vehicles inside the United States. Owners may see a lit air bag warning lamp in their vehicles if the clockspring has been compromised. This condition could be especially prevalent inside vehicles used for off-roading, the source said.</p>\n<p>Dealers will resolve the issue by modifying the steering wheel, installing a new steering-column shroud and back cover. Though no schedule was listed, the release did say that customers will receive notification once the recall progresses.</p>\n<p><strong>The second recall: Clutch release updates</strong><br />\nThe other recall centers around gradual changes that could hurt vital transmission functions in&nbsp;Fiat 500 cars with model years between 2012 and 2016, but only the models that don&#8217;t use turbocharged&nbsp;engines. The statement mentions that&nbsp;approximately 39,217 vehicles are affected by&nbsp;this.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other recall, this one has some reports of damage to the vehicles involved. The source said that .01 percent of the affected cars have been damaged, according to recent investigations, and that the recall notices sent out will give customers the necessary guidance for updating their vehicles as necessary.</p>\n<p>If left unchecked, these affected vehicles can potentially see a moving clutch, which prevents the driver from using standard manual transmission functions. No specific remedy was described in this statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Previous related issues</strong><br />\nIn addition to these recalls, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration features some information about other issues that could also affect the same vehicles. One complaint about a 2016 Fiat 500 filed in September 2015 stated that a vehicle suddenly shut off while the drivers were in the middle of the highway. The anonymous driver stated that the parking brake, service engine soon and transmission lights all turned on at once after the vehicle stalled.</p>\n<p>The Jeep Wrangler has also been subject to previous recalls similar to the most recent one. A report from May 2013 described a clockspring&nbsp;issue in&nbsp;Wrangler right-hand-drive vehicles manufactured between February 2007 and October 2011. Investigations associated with that case found that dust contamination led to circuit fatigue, a condition that may have caused&nbsp;steering column problems and also triggered air bag warning lights.</p>\n<p>The initial recall acknowledgment letter for this issue referenced 5,400 potentially affected vehicles. As with the newer actions, these vehicles were at risk of air bag circuit issues that could have left occupants less safe. The chronology of this action dated back to May 2011, when the NHTSA opened its investigations. The decision to conduct an official safety recall was made that October, after months in the wake of the safety issues.</p>\n<p>Originally, the remedy for this problem involved a steering wheel dust shield and a new clockspring, both of which the dealer was slated to replace&nbsp;beginning in May 2013. There were no accidents or injuries traced to this condition, either.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=7196","createdAt":"2016-06-23T03:50:14.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-06-23T17:35:14.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T00:43:45.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T14:28:45.000Z","display_date":"June 23, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_1138614455-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1138614455-1","category":{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"}]},{"id":7184,"title":"Vehicles in GM Recalls May Not Warn Drivers When Key is in Ignition","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/vehicles-in-gm-recalls-may-not-warn-drivers-when-key-is-in-ignition/","status":"publish","slug":"vehicles-in-gm-recalls-may-not-warn-drivers-when-key-is-in-ignition","excerpt":"<p>Three models are subject to GM recalls for a problem with the audio alert system.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Warren, Mich. — June 20, 2016 —&nbsp;</em>An important alarm feature may not work properly in some Chevrolet vehicles, as a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently stated. General Motors is taking measures to address a security fault that could allow drivers to leave their keys in the ignition slots for several vehicles with model years ranging from 2013 to 2016.</p>\n<p>Three Chevrolet models, (the Sonic, Spark and Trax vehicles) are part of this action, which extends to 317,572 units. The relatively subtle flaw may go undetected by motorists but <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM515025/RCLRPT-16V257-3287.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">could still fail Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 114</a>, the report stated, leaving the vehicle vulnerable to theft.</p>\n<p>The source said that the warning chime that should play when a driver leaves the key in the ignition may not do so, depending on how and when he or she opens&nbsp;the door. This only applies to vehicles with the Bring Your Own Media feature: In affected vehicles, the radio isn&#8217;t able to receive&nbsp;the command to exit sleep mode and prompt the proper alert.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking proper action</strong><br />\nThough there is no official recall schedule yet, the report stated that dealers can update the included radio software to function correctly and execute the right key chime. The software in Sonic and Trax vehicles built after this April 13 and April 17, respectively, are already fixed, and the radio has been discontinued in Spark models altogether.</p>\n<p>In addition, Autoblog&#8217;s article on this recall advised owners to take extra care to bring car keys when exiting a vehicle&nbsp;and not rely on the chime, in case it doesn&#8217;t work. The report lists two specific circumstances in which the chime could fail:&nbsp;if the driver takes more than 10&nbsp;minutes to open the door after turning the vehicle off and leaving the key in the ignition, or the driver takes more than 20 seconds to open the door a second time after closing it.</p>\n<p>The latter case could prove especially tricky, since the owner might hear a noise, but only a shortened version of the one he or she&nbsp;should. This is still possible evidence of the defect.</p>\n<p><strong>Calibration specifics</strong><br />\nSince the official recall submission, the NHTSA has posted a pair of safety bulletins describing the necessary measures for reprogramming the systems. This notice specifically warned dealers not to program the affected control module without instruction or an updated programming tool. Other necessary precautions include reducing battery voltage fluctuations and putting the ignition switch in the correct position, as described by the Service Programming System.</p>\n<p>Using a USB device and the vehicle&#8217;s own &#8220;infotainment display&#8221;, staff will update the necessary software and wait the required time for the changes to take effect.&nbsp;This same bulletin requires dealers to address all vehicles that arrive in their facility, ensuring completion for any models that might appear in dealer inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>FMVSS 114: A closer look</strong><br />\nThe text of this standard involves language that makes this recall a serious concern. As of 2016, FMVSS 114, which addresses &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7d443eb75ceba033fed91e90f816b574&amp;node=se49.6.571_1114&amp;rgn=div8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Theft protection and rollaway prevention</a>,&#8221; requires a starting system to respond if the key is removed.</p>\n<p>The subsections of this document allow for different possible deterrents, but removing the key must prevent the engine or motor from being activated as well as the vehicle&#8217;s steering and/or forward mobility.</p>\n<p>While there are some exceptions, vehicles must, under this standard, feature &#8220;an audible warning&#8221; to alert the driver whenever the nearest door opens while the key is still left in the ignition. The audio alert does not need to play in certain situations, such as if the key cannot turn from its position within the starting system, though this just applies to mechanical systems.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=7184","createdAt":"2016-06-20T04:40:19.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-06-20T10:25:19.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T06:44:56.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T20:29:56.000Z","display_date":"June 20, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_94857475-1-768x515.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_94857475-1","category":{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"}]},{"id":7094,"title":"Steering Column Shaft Problems Prompt New Subaru Recalls","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/steering-column-shaft-problems-prompt-new-subaru-recalls/","status":"publish","slug":"steering-column-shaft-problems-prompt-new-subaru-recalls","excerpt":"<p>The new Subaru recalls concern steering columns in multiple models.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Cherry Hill, NJ — June 16, 2016 —&nbsp;</em>A new Subaru recall effort will address 48,500 potentially compromised vehicles. Drivers in Subaru Legacy or Outback models from either the 2016 or 2017 model years may be in danger of crashing due to sudden steering loss.</p>\n<p>As a recall acknowledgment document filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted, this issue comes from steering columns that don&#8217;t properly connect the steering apparatus to the wheels.</p>\n<p>The only component listed in this statement is the column, which was reportedly machined incorrectly during manufacturing. The Safety Recall Report, also available through the NHTSA, <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM517536/RCLRPT-16V292-1003.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lists the production dates for each of the affected models</a>: They&nbsp;range from Feb. 9 to May 6, 2016. This condition could mean that the wrong tool setting was used on the column when it was in manufacturing.</p>\n<p><strong>The recall timeline</strong><br />\nAccording to the NHTSA documents, this recall has a relatively short history, with the first customer-related steering issue reported May 3. Further inspections&nbsp;followed on May 5, with the official safety recall determination coming just four days later.</p>\n<p>May 9 was listed as the dealer notification date, and as of this writing, no planned owner notification date is given on the amended report dated for May 12. The recall will also include a stop sale for any of the affected Subaru vehicles in the U.S. market.</p>\n<p>Because of the manufacturer&#8217;s fast response, it has already spurred changes to prevent this issue from hindering future vehicles. New screening practices went into use May 6. To address the potentially dangerous vehicles already in use, the report suggests dealers look at steering column lot numbers before deciding whether&nbsp;the entire column needs to be replaced.</p>\n<p>Unlike the faulty shafts, replacement parts are correctly machined and will comply with the intended specifications.&nbsp;The&nbsp;column comes from supplier&nbsp;NSK Steering Systems America, based in Michigan.</p>\n<p>All of the affected models are classified as &#8220;light vehicles&#8221; with a gas power train. While the 2017 Subaru Legacy has a 4-door body style, all of the other models are SUVs. The updated safety recall report lists the 2015 Subaru Outback as well, stating that it may have a defective steering column due to a previous service repair. Vehicle Identification Numbers are not included in this report.</p>\n<p><strong>A previous action</strong><br />\nSome of the models in this notice were subject to other recent Subaru recalls. Last November, the 2016 Legacy and Outback vehicles were involved in a different action that also resulted from incorrect manufacturing practices.</p>\n<p>As the recall report for that case noted, the drive shafts in 3,251 potential units could detach, since the fastening nuts were not properly tightened.&nbsp;This could lead to a fire hazard, since the unmoored drive shafts could hit the vehicle&#8217;s fuel tank and cause a leak.</p>\n<p>Once again, improper tool use during manufacturing was at fault, since the loose nuts were not torqued correctly during the initial production. For the vehicle to pose a true fire hazard, however, the discharged fuel would have to come into contact with a source of ignition that would spark it into a flame.</p>\n<p>This was another&nbsp;case of a fast-acting recall, since the announcement came just three days after&nbsp;Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. discovered the issue, with dealer notification then scheduled for the same day.</p>\n<p>Though the remedy mentioned possible replacement nuts and bolts, it also said that dealers could solve the issue by simply tightening these existing parts.

Documents from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recall center show that this particular recall, originally concerning leaf springs in certain Tacoma autos, has been updated multiple times this year.</p>\n<p>The first report, submitted Sept.&nbsp;26, 2014, <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM463496/RCDNN-14V604-5463.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">included 690,000 potentially affected Pre-Runner and 4&#215;4 trucks</a> produced between 2009 and 2010. These particular vehicles feature leaf springs in a certain location above the rear axle, putting it in place for several possible hazards, unlike other Tacoma models.</p>\n<p>According to this source, the faulty rear suspension leaf springs could corrode, fracture or even puncture the fuel tank, causing a leak and possible fire hazard. While the original report didn&#8217;t feature any remedy description, later updates were announced as the procedure became available for different regions.</p>\n<p>The most recent of these, dated for April 21, 2016, stated that the remedy was available for the San Francisco area, as Phase 10 of the entire operation. Owners that were left out of previous efforts due to location may be addressed in the later rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>The recall remedy</strong><br />\nAs the San Francisco update noted, dealers may have to repair and replace both the faulty leaf spring and any of the systems hurt by it. The updated number of vehicles has expanded to 711,000, with the suspected production period now stretching further back to 2004.</p>\n<p>The notice includes two other phases currently in the interim stage,&nbsp;with anticipated remedy dates trailing through the end of April and into early May. One will address vehicles registered for Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas, while the second will apply to Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>To actually fix these vehicles, technicians will need to meet appropriate certification requirements and may require&nbsp;the specially shipped leaf spring kits. The latest Technical Instructions describes the methods of&nbsp;removing old leaf springs and installing the new ones, as well as a description of proper shackle bushing replacement steps.</p>\n<p>Technicians may need to inspect the fuel tank, shock absorber, brakeline and ABS wireharness for damage, in addition to the leaf springs. Even if there is no damage, the instructions direct dealers to proceed to the leaf spring replacement procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>Other 2014 Tacoma actions</strong><br />\nAs other NHTSA documents show, 2014 saw other Toyota recalls affect the Tacoma. This model was part of a larger action meant to address possible seat heater wiring damage as a result of front seat cushion compression.</p>\n<p>With this recall, Tacoma model years between 2006 and 2011 were affected: Other&nbsp;Toyota models included the Avalon, Camry and Corolla. The original Recall Acknowledgement letter stated that a short circuit in the seat wiring could both burn through the seat and injure possible occupants.</p>\n<p>The remedy required dealers to disconnect affected heaters, with the owners at risk found specifically in the southeastern United States, in states like Florida, Georgia and Alabama.</p>\n<p>An even earlier recall from the same year also concerned Toyota Tacoma vehicles, this one targeting model years between 2008 and 2014, as well as FJ Cruisers vehicles with the same year range.</p>\n<p>Tire placards in these vehicles were found to potentially display incorrect information. Each of these brands received its own set of remedy instructions: For the Tacoma, dealer staff may have needed to place a new overlay label to help make the data more accurate.</p>\n<p>As these instructions mentioned, a display with the wrong cold tire pressure could violate the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, while also causing problems if owners attempt to inflate the tires to meet the incorrect pressure level.</p>\n<p>In that case, the manufacturer stated it would send the correct overlay stickers to both owners and dealers to conduct the fix.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=7088","createdAt":"2016-06-13T03:17:16.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-06-13T17:02:16.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T06:53:35.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T20:38:35.000Z","display_date":"June 13, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_353479238-1-768x432.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_353479238-1","category":{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"}]},{"id":7077,"title":"FCA Recalls Wide Model Year Range of Dodge Journey Vehicles","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/fca-recalls-wide-model-year-range-of-dodge-journey-vehicles/","status":"publish","slug":"fca-recalls-wide-model-year-range-of-dodge-journey-vehicles","excerpt":"<p>A new recall concerns an issue that could especially affect vehicles in cold climates.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Auburn Hills, Mich. — June 10, 2016 —&nbsp;</em>A new recall from FCA&nbsp;concerns vehicles from a span of five different model years.
