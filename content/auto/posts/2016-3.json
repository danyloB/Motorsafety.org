A Part 573 Safety Recall report has the details on the issue, which appears in autos produced between February 1, 2013, and November 30, 2015. Maserati first started investigating the problem last February. Dealers and owners will both be notified on April 29, and the dealer inspection is expected to take an hour to complete.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<p>As the report stated, these Maserati recalls involve 28,235 vehicles of two different model types: the&nbsp;Quattroporte&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ghibli.

The vehicles were manufactured at the same assembly plant in Kansas City. In a press release on the new Ford recalls, the manufacturer stated that dealers will inspect and repair the faulty buckles, replacing them if needed.</p>\n<p>While no injuries have been connected to this issue, the press release did explain the possible danger to occupants posed by this defect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rear seat belt buckles are being damaged when heavy objects are placed on top of them, which could cause the buckle not to latch completely, increasing the risk of injury in a crash,&#8221; the release said. The same statement also referenced a recall for 3,700 Ford F-150 trucks, most of which are in the United States as well. A seat massage function could disable the airbag system in the passenger seat. Dealers will address this issue by updating the module software to fix the vehicle&#8217;s classification systems.</p>\n<p>These recent Ford recalls come after a previous action targeting 2015 Transits for a seat belt assembly issue. The belts required a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard violation because they didn&#8217;t bear the correct labels, which normally list the belt model and model year.</p>\n<p>This represented a risk to owner safety because it made it potentially difficult for users to read crucial model information on the belt itself. The manufacturer officially launched this earlier recall on June 12, 2015&nbsp;for fewer than 50 units.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=6094","createdAt":"2016-03-03T01:29:20.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-03-03T15:14:20.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T01:30:28.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T15:15:28.000Z","display_date":"March 03, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":3,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_656649172-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_656649172","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":6080,"title":"Seatbelt Issues Lead to Worldwide Toyota RAV4 Recall","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/seatbelt-issues-lead-to-worldwide-toyota-rav4-recall/","status":"publish","slug":"seatbelt-issues-lead-to-worldwide-toyota-rav4-recall","excerpt":"<p>A new Toyota recall affects millions of vehicles with possible seatbelt issues around the world.</p>\n","description":"<p><input id=\"br-article-id\" name=\"br-article-id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"40030200\"></p>\n<p><em>Torrance, CA — March 02, 2016 — </em>Although most of the vehicles in a new Toyota recall are in North America, this action affects almost 3 million SUVs around the world.

The manufacturing production dates stretch as far back as 2005.

Models manufactured between July and October in 2010 are subject to a possible transmission fluid leak, due to badly produced hoses. Although the official recall began only recently, it represents five years of investigations and response actions, with the first notifications coming from a dealer in September 2011.</p>\n<p>Owners and dealers alike have a few symptoms to help them determine whether or not a particular vehicle is at risk. According to the Part 573 Safety Recall Report, affected models are light SUV&#8217;s with automatic transaxles. If the transmission hose is visibly leaking fluid, the Malfunction Indicator Lamp is on or the vehicle is shifting unusually, the driver might be at risk.</p>\n<p>The vehicle manufacturer will notify owners beginning March 25, with dealers notified on the same date, though the official schedule for the recall was not reported. However, this document did describe <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM496822/RCLRPT-16V057-3076.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some of the observations uncovered in previous investigations</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The investigation revealed that certain hoses manufactured from August 2010 through October 2010 might have been improperly cured during the manufacturing process, lowering the hose rubber durability and creating the potential for the hose to rupture and split,&#8221; the document said. Faulty hoses could potentially leak enough transmission fluid to put the vehicle in danger.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Subaru also recalled thousands of vehicles for transmission fluid leak concerns. Instead of a hose, this effort was prompted by a &#8220;deformed&#8221; seal cap inside a propeller shaft yoke that could have leaked fluid onto an exhaust pipe. The repair required dealers to replace the entire propeller shaft assembly following a stop sale order.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=6082","createdAt":"2016-03-01T01:54:41.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-03-01T15:39:41.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T23:43:53.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T13:28:53.000Z","display_date":"March 01, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":3,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hyundai-Compact-SUV-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Hyundai-Compact-SUV","category":{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"}]}]
