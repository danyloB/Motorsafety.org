There is a potential issue with the ignition switch, which may be connected to the deployment of airbags or the engine cutting off unexpectedly. Nissan has also been a part of the massive Takata airbag recall this year.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The ignition switch where the key is inserted into certain Nissan vehicles is potentially wearing down prematurely. The risk is cars shutting off while the vehicle is in motion if the ignition switch wears down over time. This could offer a risk of an accident, loss of vehicle control or a crash.</p>\n<p>Certain Juke SUVs, Frontier pickup trucks, Sentras, Versas, NV and NV200 van models from 2017 and 2018 are part of this particular recall. Nissan vehicles that have keyless ignition are not a part of this specific recall. About 13,000 of these vehicles are in the U.S, while the remaining 153,000 are in Canada. For now, Nissan recommends that all owners and drivers remove additional objects from their key ring that could cause issues, such as key chains and additional keys.</p>\n<p>Nissan is also involved in the massive Takata airbag recall this year too, according to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/08/29/takata-airbags-recall-exploding-extreme-heat/\">Fortune</a>. Airbags are susceptible to explode if exposed to high heat or humidity. Tens of millions of cars are affected by this recall, including Nissan. The Takata recall is the biggest recall in U.S. history, and linked to at least 180 injuries and 20 deaths. 19 different automakers have been affected by the recall, with companies such as Ford, Toyota and Nissan having to pay out large settlements for consumer loss claims.</p>\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://www.nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall.html\">Nissan website</a>, it&#8217;s reported that only 39 percent of the recall has been completed to date, meaning there are many more vehicles still on the road with this airbag risk. The automaker is offering incentives such as free repairs and free alternative transportation to those waiting on fixes. They advise to take the airbag recall seriously, as the defect can seriously injure those inside the car, or even be fatal in certain situations.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In late August, spokespeople from Nissan confirmed that they would perform the recall on certain vehicle models. There will be official announcements about the plan and execution in the coming days in the U.S., following the announcement by Transport Canada already this week.</p>\n<p>Next month, Nissan will officially begin contacting those who may be affected by their recall, including drivers, owners and dealerships. Most likely, Nissan will offer complimentary inspections and repairs to the ignition switches of any of their cars and SUVs that are a part of this specific recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>If drivers, owners and dealerships are concerned about the recent Nissan recall, they can find more information from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) via <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/\">their website</a>, or call their hotline at 1-800-424-9153. However, the recall has not yet been officially announced on the NHTSA website. To contact Nissan directly in the U.S., those looking for more information can call 1-800-647-7261.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=15939","createdAt":"2018-08-31T00:51:51.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-08-31T14:36:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T22:06:05.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T11:51:05.000Z","display_date":"August 31, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2018,"month":8,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Nissan-Juke-768x484.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Nissan-Juke","category":{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"}]},{"id":15937,"title":"Rear Seat Lock Striker Issue Causes Volvo Recall","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/rear-seat-lock-striker-issue-causes-volvo-recall/","status":"publish","slug":"rear-seat-lock-striker-issue-causes-volvo-recall","excerpt":"<p>Volvo Car USA LLC recalls vehicles XC40s that have potential faulty seat backs. The seat can move unexpectedly while the vehicle is moving.  </p>\n","description":"<p><em>U.S. – Aug. 30, 2018 –</em> According to <a href=\"https://www.usrecallnews.com/volvo-18v535000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener, nofollow noopener noreferrer\">US Recall News</a>, Volvo Car USA LLC (Volvo) has announced a recall for some of its vehicles that have potential faulty seat backs. In the event of a crash or accident, these seat backs could move rapidly and unexpectedly, posing a risk for injury to passengers inside the car. This recall is in line with several others this year by Volvo over interior faulty components, including oil pressure indicators, headlights and starter motor fuses.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>In the back rear seats of certain Volvos, there might be a missing key component that secured the back of the seat in place. The rear seat back lock strikers are part of the seat back that moves backward and forward for adjusting. In the event of sudden movement, such as hard braking, stopping rapidly or a crash, this lock striker could come loose and not have the seat secured properly. This put the passenger at risk of injury in crash circumstances.</p>\n<p>The vehicle model involved in this particular recall is the 2019 Volvo XC40. This is a compact SUV in the Volvo line that comes in three styles: the Momentum, the Inscription and the R-Design. According to Volvo&#8217;s website, there will be a full electric version of the XC40 manufactured in 2020.</p>\n<p>About 25 vehicles are being recalled for this specific faulty part in the rear seats. So far, there has been no reports of injury or accidents due to the problem with the rear seat backs and lock strikers.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/11/09/volvo-recall-vehicles-seatbelt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener, nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Fortune</a>, one of Volvo&#8217;s biggest recalls in recent history involved 74,000 vehicles in 2016. It posed a potentially dangerous situation, as there was issues with the seat belt mechanisms found in 2016 and 2017 Volvo S60, S90, V60, VC60 and XC90 models. The lock was not working correctly, putting drivers and passengers at risk for not being secure in the moving vehicle. Volvo offered full inspections of the seat belts and notified all owners by mail, and did further checks at dealerships to unsold cars. No injuries or accidents were reported relating to the specific recall.</p>\n<p>This year has seen several other recalls for Volvos, according to <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/recalls/volvo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener, nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Edmunds</a>. More than 7,700 models from 2014 have been recalled due to potential signaling and headlight malfunctions, as well as another 7,800 from 2016 that could have issues with the starter motor fuse. Certain Volvo S60s, about 30,000 total, are also being recalled over a problem with the indicator that alerts drivers of low oil pressure.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Earlier this month, Volvo made the recall announcement for certain XC40 models. They are offering repairs to the faulty seat components and vehicle interior checks for owners. If the seat back lock striker is missing from the vehicle, Volvo will replace it free of charge during the inspection. Officially, the recall will begin on October 15, 2018. Owners and drivers will be notified of the issue so they can take measurements to rectify the recall.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>If drivers, owners and dealerships are concerned about the recent Volvo recall, they can find out if their vehicle is affected by this recall by using <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MotorSafety’s </span><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free vehicle lookup tool</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=15937","createdAt":"2018-08-30T01:24:28.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-08-30T15:09:28.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-26T01:58:15.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-26T15:43:15.000Z","display_date":"August 30, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"18V535000","recall_date":"August 15, 2018"},"year":2018,"month":8,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Orage-Volvo-XC40-stock-photo-front-quarter-view-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"Orage Volvo XC40 stock photo front quarter view","cld_public_id":"Orage-Volvo-XC40-stock-photo-front-quarter-view","category":{"id":19,"name":"Volvo","slug":"volvo-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Volvo-logo-2012-2048x2048-1.png"},"tags":[{"id":1661,"name":"2019 Volvo XC40 recall","slug":"2019-volvo-xc40-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":19,"name":"Volvo","slug":"volvo-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Volvo-logo-2012-2048x2048-1.png"}]},{"id":16320,"title":"Volkswagon Recalls Vehicles for Defective Brake Calipers","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagon-recalls-vehicles-for-defective-brake-calipers/","status":"publish","slug":"volkswagon-recalls-vehicles-for-defective-brake-calipers","excerpt":"","description":"<div class=\"video-wrapper feature-video\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/307144275?app_id=122963\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Volkswagon Recalls Vehicles for Defective Brake Calipers\" allow=\"autoplay;

According to USA Today, FCA is calling to fix vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and in other countries globally due to a faulty tailgate issue.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>U.S. – Aug. 29, 2018 –</em> Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has announced a recall for more than 1.1 million Dodge Ram trucks. According to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/08/02/fiat-chrysler-ram-pickup-recall/887544002/\">USA Today</a>, FCA is calling to fix vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and in other countries globally due to a faulty tailgate issue. The official recall will begin in September of this year.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Through an investigation by the automakers, it was discovered that certain power locking mechanisms in the tailgate system have problems. The component that helps automatically latch the tailgate can corrode over time at a faster rate than normal, which can cause the system to not operate correctly. If the tailgate unlatches unexpectedly, it could cause cargo to fall out the back of the pickup truck. This can put drivers and others on the road in danger of an accident, injury or crash.</p>\n<p>The trucks affected in the recall include models with the 5&#8242; 7&#8243; or 6&#8242; 4&#8243; truck bed. They are the 2015-2017 RAM 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks. The current models of 2018 and 2019 Ram trucks are not part of this recall over tailgate issues, as they are equipped with new features such as lift-assist.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.thedrive.com/news/21102/here-are-the-cars-with-the-highest-and-lowest-recall-rates\">The Drive</a>, the overall average for car recalls per make and model is 0.79 per 100,000 units sold. In the list of top 10 vehicles with the most recalls, the Ram Pickup comes in at number six, behind the Nissan Pathfinder and Dodge Durango. The Ram Pickup has a 1.99 rating per 100,000 units sold, more than double the average. Domestic automakers take up six of the top 10 spaces for the most recalled vehicles, while Japanese automakers are among the lowest.</p>\n<p>Four of the top 10 vehicles are offered by FCA: Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler or Fiat. Due to a large recall in May involving 4.8 million vehicles, this tipped the scales for the averages this year. In comparison, some of the least recalled makes and models in the U.S. include the Hyundai Accent, Chevrolet Equinox and the Toyota Corolla.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Earlier this month, FCA announced the recall for the Ram trucks. So far, there have been no injuries or accidents relating directly to this specific recall. There are exactly 1,149,237 trucks involved in the recall in the U.S. An additional 260,315 vehicles in Canada; 19,432 in Mexico and 25,361 trucks in other countries worldwide are also part of the recall.</p>\n<p>Beginning September 14, FCA will officially begin the recall. Any trucks at risk for the faulty tailgate will be able to take their truck in for repairs and fixes of the parts. In the meantime, spokespeople from FCA urge owners to make sure cargo is extra secure and all safety precautions are followed in the Dodge RAM manual.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Chrysler announced plans to notify owners of the problem with the tailgates. The automaker also suggests using some of the other features and equipment included in the tailgate mechanisms to ensure cargo can be as secure as possible. This includes (but is not limited to) investing in higher friction truck bed liners, bulkhead dividers, bed extenders and tie-down rings.</p>\n<p>If auto dealerships and drivers would like more information, they can contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which can be reached via <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/\">their website</a>. Costumers who would like to contact Chrysler directly in the US can call their helpline at 1-800-334-9200. For reference, the recall official number from FCA is U74.

This could cause air bags not to deploy in certain situations. MBUSA is looking further into the potential matter to take action on the official recall.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The OCS is the electrical system that makes the driver aware if other passengers in the car need to fasten a seat belt. It also allows the car to know if it should deploy an airbag in the event of an accident. Indicators include features like pressure-sensitive mats and weight sensors, which can carry information about the particular passenger. All modern vehicles today have similar systems installed, such as the Seat Occupant Sensors (SOS), Passenger Weight Systems (PWS) or the Occupant Detection System (ODS). In the recalled vehicles, this indicator is said to not react if there is a child or child seat in the front passenger side of the car. This means if there was a crash, the airbag would not be deactivated and the child runs the risk of serious injury.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6436a7.htm\">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), National Child Passenger Safety Week is September 17-23. The CDC advises that no children under 12 years of age should be in the front seat of a vehicle. Child seats should not be in the front seat passenger side, because airbags can pose a risk to the child. This is especially risky for children under 2 who are strongly suggested to be in rear-facing car seats.</p>\n<p>Once a child is of the age or weight requirement, they can sit in the passenger seat with a normal-sized belt. Children are said to be safest in a vehicle, in either a regular belt or child seat, that is located in the middle back seat. If parents and guardians are concerned, they can have a certified Child Passenger Safety Technician check seats and anchoring components for proper installation.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On August 3, MBUSA made an announcement regarding the recall for the problematic OCS.</p>\n<p>The 345 cars included in this recall are certain 2018 Mercedes-Benz E300, E300 4Matic, E43 AMG 4Matic, E400 4Matic, E63S AMG 4Matic+, and 2019 CLS450 4Matic models. An additional 86 Mercedes-Benz CLA250, CLA250 4Matic, and CLA45 AMG 4Matic 2018 vehicles are also part of the recall.</p>\n<p>As a small side recall, four additional cars of the same models are part of the series that have defective sunroofs. The panoramic sunroof runs a risk of coming detached while driving, which could cause potential injury or a crash.</p>\n<p>Starting October 3, MBUSA will start to offer inspections, part replacements and repairs to the vehicles affected by the recall.

Consumers and dealerships will be notified of the problem, which could lead to injury or a crash if not properly addressed for repairs and replacement. More than 8,400 cars are involved in the recall.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Mounting bolts found in the brake caliper bracket could have a deficiency due to a manufacturing issue. The fasteners directly affect how the brake system operates. If loose or not installed correctly, drivers could potentially lose the ability to brake or control the vehicles, causing a crash or injury to those inside the car.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-parts/brake-calipers.htm\">How Stuff Works</a>, the brake calipers are part of the mechanism that squeezes break pads against the brake rotor. Most modern vehicles have disc brake systems in the front, and often in the back, where these calipers would be found. Break fluid is released when the brake pedal is operated, which causes friction between pad and rotor. As the rotor slows down, so does the wheel, completing the braking system. If there&#8217;s a compromise in the power of the friction, it&#8217;s known as brake fade. So when the caliper potentially has loose bolts, this can put the metal caliper off-kilter to the rotor. The driver will be unable to use brakes correctly, resulting in loss of control or a crash.</p>\n<p>When Volkswagen notifies the owners, they will offer replacement parts and complimentary repairs. This includes tightening the brake caliper bolts or re-torqueing them. Mechanics can also check bleeder valves, brake hose bolts and fasteners to ensure all parts are in correct working order. On certain Passat models, the braking cable will also be checked.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Earlier this month, Volkswagen made the announcement to recall the vehicles. Those included are some 2018 Volkswagen Atlas models and 2017-2018 Volkswagen Passat vehicles. In total, 8,416 cars are involved in this particular recall.</p>\n<p>The official recall is expected to begin by October 14, when owners will be notified, and repairs will start to be offered.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, there was an international recall of more than 700,000 Volkswagen vehicles, according to <a href=\"https://www.industryweek.com/companies-executives/volkswagen-recalls-700000-suvs\">Industry Week</a>. There was an issue with built-in lights that could potentially short circuit. This ran the risk of causing damage to parts of the roof and even fires to the interior of the cars. Models part of the recall were specific Tiguan and Touran vehicles manufactured before July 5 of this year. There is an ongoing investigation into the issue before the cars are officially asked to be brought in for repairs by Volkswagen spokespeople. Drivers in this instance were asked to watch for visible signs of singeing on the roof panels.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen vehicles have undergone several recalls this summer, including another 124,000 electric cars. These Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche automobiles had potential carcinogenic cadmium in the batteries that need to be fixed or replaces due to poisoning risk over time.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Volkswagen announced plans to directly notify owners of the potential airbag problem.

This could prove to be a high-risk situation for drivers and potentially lead to injuries during crashes, as seats can become prematurely detached due to the faulty part. Steps are in place to remedy the situation as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Proper installation of the child seat anchoring system, or ISOFIX, may have been overlooked in 39 Mercedes cars. Those included in the recall are Mercedes-Benz E400 Cabrios and E400 4Matic Cabrios.</p>\n<p>If during a crash the ISOFIX does not work properly, some of the console could tear away from the vehicle unexpectedly. If there is a child seat and child involved, there is a risk for injury.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.childcarseats.org.uk/types-of-seat/isofix-seats/\">Childcarseats.org</a>, the ISOFIX is an international standard in many vehicles to have certain secure points that pass safety tests with all regulation car seats. As there can be large differences between various seatbelts, seats and how the components are anchored, the ISOFIX can help standardize the variables to provide additional safety checkpoints. Some of these anchor points include top tether metal parts that allow for looping of belts and straps, as well as alligator clips for the bottom. The system can account for child passengers up to 72 pounds in booster seats and regular child car seats. ISOFIX can also be referred to as LATCH, LUAS or Canfix in other countries.</p>\n<p>Alongside the ISOFIX system, all child car seats should have proper alignment for the seatbelt strap, adjustments to headrests and options support legs. The system attached to these Mercedes models does not include the child car seat itself or other safety components.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On August 2, MBUSA made an announcement that the recall for faulty child seat anchoring components. There was concern for increased risk of injury to children if involved in a crash. So far, there have been no reported injuries related to this specific recall.</p>\n<p>Starting October 3, MBUSA will start to offer inspections, part replacements and repairs to the vehicles affected by the recall. This protocol is free of charge to consumers and dealerships as needed.</p>\n<p>Recently, there has been a massive recall of Mercedes cars in Germany, according to <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/mercedes-parent-forced-to-recall-238000-diesel-cars-over-deceptive-software/\">Adweek</a>. More than 230,000 cars were involved in this recall, which are only part of a string of recalls that could potentially amount to millions. The issue has to do with tracking emissions, which potentially gives false readings. It can make the cars seem like they are qualified to pass emission tests when in reality, they are not. Automaker and MBUSA partner Daimler states they are willing to inspect the issue and replace faulty parts, but claim the issue was not deliberate. Other officials say it may have been to help pass emission tests deceitfully, and there is an ongoing investigation. This effects cars internationally manufactured in various countries across the globe.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>MBUSA announced plans to directly notify owners of the problem.

FCA states they will replace the powertrain control module free of charge for consumers and dealerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also this month, FCA recalled similar 2018 &#8211; 2019 Jeep and Dodge models for brake fluid issues. More than 200,000 vehicles were included in this recall, which required brake fluid to be replaced complimentary to avoid potential bigger issues with the systems. Breaking and steering issues are imperative to fix immediately, due to the higher risks of crashes involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/e-team/cleveland-jeep-recall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">In June</a>, a woman in Ohio claimed to have a steering issue with her Jeep, causing it to lockup while she was operating her car.

More than 150,000 vehicles are part of this recall, where Chrysler suggests replacement of parts and fixes to avoid potential risk and injury. It is part of a series of recalls this year relating to the breaking system in the Jeep and Dodge models.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Coating on the rear break caliber pistons is said to be default on some of the Dodge and Jeep models. Included are select models of the 2018-2019 Dodge Grand Caravan and 2018 Journey, as well as the 2018-2019 Jeep Compass and 2019 Jeep Cherokee. The piston issue can cause gas pockets to form, which may compromise the use of the rear braking system. As of now, no injuries or accidents have been reported in relation to this particular recall.</p>\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://haynes.com/en-us/tips-tutorials/what-is-brake-caliper-piston-and-what-does-it-do\">Haynes Manuals</a>, the break pistons work by allowing the break pads to connect with the brake discs. There are often several found in each breaking system in modern cars. If this part has flow issues, it can cause the breaks to operate incorrectly, such as having break pads stick or unbalanced amounts of brake fluid reaching the metal parts. It can be from common wear and tear, or an issue in manufacturing. This puts the driver and passengers at risk for not having full control in the vehicle.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>This week, the Chrysler company announced the recall of 154,335 Jeep and Dodge vehicles for the break problems, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). By September 28, owners and dealers will be notified of the defect and offered solutions for repair.</p>\n<p>In May of this year, there was a recall of more than 4.8 million Dodge, Jeep and Ram vehicles from the FCA, according to <a href=\"https://www.cars.com/articles/48-million-chrysler-dodge-jeep-and-ram-vehicles-recall-alert-1420700111384/\">Cars.com</a>. The large recall affected models from 2014-2018 that have automatic transmissions and gas engines. There was an issue with the cruise control and its electrical components, which ran the risk of the vehicle potentially accelerating and brake disengagement not working when in a cruise control mode. The automakers offered to fix the issue free of charge.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>So far, the only models affected by this recall announcement are Dodge Grand Caravan, Jeep Compass, Dodge Journey and Jeep Cherokee from 2018-2019. Chrysler plans to contact owners and dealers starting September 28.

The faulty 2019 Ascent SUV model&nbsp;is&nbsp;missing key welds on the back-door hinges, and spokespeople from Subaru have chosen to pull the cars with the issue from the market.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>In key areas of the weld, there are spots missing along the B-pillar, which is located on the second-row door hinges. Subaru stated that the issue was due to incorrect programming in the welding software for the robots that manufacture the vehicles. If these doors or other car parts came loose due to the defect, it can cause risks of injury and accidents.</p>\n<p>According to a Subaru representative, only nine of the defective vehicles were sold to the general public. They will replace all vehicles made and sold due to the severity of the defect. However, there have been no reports of any crashes or injuries of the Ascent SUV falling under this specific issue.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On July 21, the issue of defective welds was discovered on-property at a routine inspection. Due to the manufacturing error being contained swiftly, vehicles made between July 13-21 are affected. The total is 293 SUVs that are part of this specific recall.</p>\n<p>There are 383,101 Subaru vehicles involved in the massive Takata airbag recall this year, which <a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/subaru-recalls-383101-vehicles-in-expanded-takata-airbag-recall.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">does not include the new Subaru Ascent SUV</a>, according to Edmunds. Six models between 2003-2011 were affected.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>If consumers or retailers would like to contact Subaru&#8217;s customer service department directly, they can do so at 844-373-6614. Also, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) can <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/owners/SearchCurrentMonthRecall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">provide additional information</a> with the claim number 18V-508 on the NHTSA website. Subaru stated they plan to inform owners who bought the SUVs directly.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=15894","createdAt":"2018-08-18T05:16:02.000Z","date_gmt":"2018-08-18T19:01:02.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T22:35:42.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T12:20:42.000Z","display_date":"August 18, 2018","sticky":false,"recall":false,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2018,"month":8,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2019-Subaru-Ascent-768x578.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"2019-Subaru-Ascent","category":{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"}]}]
