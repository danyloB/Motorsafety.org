Also included are 1,200 Versa Notes and 41 Rogues.</p>\n<p>In these autos, the door locks on the driver and rear left side doors may not latch properly. This is because of an error from the supplier, Magna Closures, and leaves passengers at risk if the doors open while the car is in motion. Nissan dealers will solve the problem by inspecting recalled vehicles and replacing affected door locks, a process that is both free and can take as little as one hour to complete.</p>\n<p>Thank you for watching, and please check back for the latest major recall news.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=10757","createdAt":"2015-08-13T17:39:33.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-08-14T07:24:33.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-04-02T04:37:26.000Z","modified_gmt":"2018-04-02T18:22:26.000Z","display_date":"August 13, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":null,"nhtsa_campaign_number":null,"recall_date":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null,"custom_schema":null},"year":2015,"month":8,"alt_text":"","cld_public_id":null,"category":{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"}]},{"id":14762,"title":"Thousands of Cadillacs Added to Sunroof Related Recall","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/thousands-of-cadillacs-added-to-sunroof-related-recall/","status":"publish","slug":"thousands-of-cadillacs-added-to-sunroof-related-recall","excerpt":"<p>Detroit, MI — August 4, 2015 — General Motors is adding to a recall for thousands of Cadillacs around the world as it addresses a possible sunroof switch issue.

Only when recall statements are released to the widest possible owner audience can dealers be sure that the right message is getting out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check your car’s recall status using MotorSafety’s <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">free vehicle lookup tool</a>.</p>\n<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script>","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=4286","createdAt":"2015-08-04T11:12:16.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-08-05T00:57:16.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-25T01:09:38.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-09-25T14:54:38.000Z","display_date":"August 04, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":"August 4, 2015"},"year":2015,"month":8,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/White-Cadillac-sedan-city-street-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"White Cadillac ATS on a city street.","cld_public_id":"White-Cadillac-sedan-city-street","category":{"id":36,"name":"Cadillac","slug":"cadillac-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cadillac.png"},"tags":[{"id":829,"name":"Cadillac ATS","slug":"cadillac-ats"},{"id":784,"name":"Cadillac Recall","slug":"cadillac-recall"},{"id":842,"name":"Sunroof","slug":"sunroof"}],"categories":[{"id":36,"name":"Cadillac","slug":"cadillac-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cadillac.png"}]}]
