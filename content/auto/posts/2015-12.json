The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) acknowledged an action that targets both Legacy and Outback models, reported as of November 20. According to the official Safety Recall Report, the propeller shaft nuts can come loose, perhaps leading to a sudden risk of fire damage inside the vehicle.</p>\n<p>This problem was first discovered on November 17, when&nbsp;Subaru of Indiana Automotive discovered that <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM491729/RCLRPT-15V794-2950.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the torque was improperly fastened</a>. Three days later, an official decision to launch the recall was made. A total of 3,251 vehicles are included in this recall, with the action originally scheduled for December 10, under the number&nbsp;WQV-57. Subaru dealers will tighten the loose nuts if necessary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the propeller shaft detaches from the differential, the shaft could strike the&nbsp;fuel tank resulting in a possible fuel leak,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;There is a risk of fire if leaking fuel&nbsp;were to come in contact with an ignition source. This could happen without&nbsp;prior warning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the official repair procedure describes, some dealers might not require extra parts at all to repair this condition. Bolts, nuts and washers must be replaced in the defective units, but only if nuts are found to be &#8220;finger-tight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dealers are advised to be gentle and avoid damaging the dust cover on the differential seal, since a replacement might be required if the seal is broken. Those doing the installation can make sure the nuts, bolts and washers all line up by checking for telltale flange and yoke paint lines.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=5772","createdAt":"2015-12-23T01:44:58.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-12-23T15:29:58.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T21:08:41.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T10:53:41.000Z","display_date":"December 23, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/New-Subaru-Outback-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"New-Subaru-Outback","category":{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":24,"name":"Subaru","slug":"subaru-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/subaru_ms.png"}]},{"id":5774,"title":"BMW Recalls MINI Coopers for Cushion Issues","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-recalls-mini-coopers-for-cushion-issues/","status":"publish","slug":"bmw-recalls-mini-coopers-for-cushion-issues","excerpt":"<p>BMW of North America, LLC recalls several MINI Cooper vehicles were recalled due to air bag calibration issues.</p>\n","description":"<p><input id=\"br-article-id\" name=\"br-article-id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"40027253\" /></p>\n<p><em>Woodcliff Lake, NJ — December 22, 2015 — </em>A problem with seat cushion replacement parts in some recently-produced MINI Coopers could interfere with safe airbag use. According to documents posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) last month, nearly 40 vehicles suffer from a Capacitive Interior Sensing (CIS) system that could place front seat passengers at greater risk during a crash.</p>\n<p>This is because the sensors could improperly register the occupant in the front seat, either activating or deactivating the air bags incorrectly. While a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2015/RCLQRT-15V739-4372.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 573 Safety Recall report</a> on the issue states that 53 vehicles were originally thought to have received the possibly faulty mats, the number has since been adjusted to 38. There are currently no reports of accidents related to this concern, and vehicles owners will still be able to use the &#8220;passenger airbag off lamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The remedy for this recall requires replacing the front passenger seat. Both the report and a &#8220;Q&amp;A&#8221; document available through the NHTSA explain the reasons behind the defective CIS system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CIS mat is designed to differentiate between an installed child restraint system and an adult occupant,&#8221; they state. &#8220;In affected vehicles, incorrectly calibrated CIS mats may have been installed in the front passenger seat cushion replacement parts. Occupant classification could be impaired, leading to inappropriate air bag activation/deactivation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Q&amp;A clarifies that owners may still drive their vehicles, as long as they follow instructions from letters prompting them to get service done. Passengers should also avoid sitting in the front seats of vehicles when the &#8220;airbag off lamp&#8221; turns on.</p>\n<p>Affected models in these BMW recalls include MINI Cooper and MINI Cooper S autos produced between 2014 and 2015.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=5774","createdAt":"2015-12-22T02:17:18.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-12-22T16:02:18.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T02:47:31.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T16:32:31.000Z","display_date":"December 22, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":6,"name":"MotorSafety.org","slug":"motorsafety"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"15V739000","recall_date":"November 9, 2015"},"year":2015,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_352128461-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_352128461","category":{"id":31,"name":"Mini","slug":"mini-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mini_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1793,"name":"2014-2015 Mini Cooper recall","slug":"2014-2015-mini-cooper-recall"},{"id":1794,"name":"2014-2105 Mini Cooper S recall","slug":"2014-2105-mini-cooper-s-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":31,"name":"Mini","slug":"mini-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mini_RM.png"}]},{"id":5757,"title":"Ford Recalls Vehicles with Possible Fuel Tank Cracks","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-vehicles-with-possible-fuel-tank-cracks/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-recalls-vehicles-with-possible-fuel-tank-cracks","excerpt":"<p>A new Ford recall addresses possible fuel tank problems in Fusion and Mercury Milan vehicles.
