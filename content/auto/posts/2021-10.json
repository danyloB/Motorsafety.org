GM blamed the defect on the supplier, Vitesco, but did not provide a specific cause for the fault.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall is based on 617 related complaints and 229 reports of stalls drawn from warranty claim data. GM said it was not aware of any injuries related to this issue to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stalling out on the road puts the car at risk of being hit by faster-moving traffic.

The recall centers around a particular joint in the suspension that could become corroded and “seize up”, causing the toe links to snap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joint is vulnerable to corrosion from salt, which is used to de-ice roads in cold areas. The recall includes vehicles that were sold in, or at any point, registered in, the following “salt-belt” states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/own-or-buying-a-used-car-three-things-you-must-do-to-check-for-recalls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">If you own a used ca​​r, check this page to make sure you will be alerted if your car is part of this recall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the knuckle joint seizes up and breaks the toe link, it will allow the wheel to wiggle around and misdirect the car. &nbsp;You can read more about the risks in this article about a related <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-explorers-for-fourth-time-due-to-steering-loss/\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Ford toe link recall.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these older cars have not yet caused any accidents or injuries, problems relating to the 2020 recall caused at least <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RMISC-20V675-0070.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">13 accidents and six injuries.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Background of the recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 8, 2021, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-explorers-for-fourth-time-due-to-steering-loss/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford recalled over 644,000 2013-2017 Explorers in the United States</a> based on 48 reported toe link fractures, but the company was concerned that pre-2013 cars could pose a problem, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These vehicles were built before Ford started routinely installing the faulty knuckle joints in 2013 cars. However, Ford believes around 2,800 older vehicles may have been subesquently repaired using the faulty knuckle joints, which is why the older Explorers are being recalled now. Ford must check over 126,000 cars to identify these 2,800 vehicles and inspect them for damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other toe link recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford has recalled cars over toe link fractures at least <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V675,19V435,16V245\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">three times in the past five years</a> when prior recall campaigns failed to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General Motors also recently recalled cars over toe link fractures.

This recall includes 95,515 cars and is caused by &#8220;premature wear&#8221; of engine components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affected vehicles include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2017 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid</strong></li><li><strong>2017 Hyundai Tucson</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Connection rods are engine components which help reduce friction between moving parts in the engine. In affected vehicles, these bearings may suffer from &#8220;premature wear,&#8221; <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V727000\" target=\"_blank\">which may cause the engine to stall while driving</a>. In addition, the connection rod can snap and pierce the engine, which results in oil leaks that may cause fire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All vehicles that are part of this Hyundai recall have a 2.0-liter “Nu” GDI engine made in their plant in Ulsan, South Korea, between May 12, 2016 and December 27, 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Warning signs include a metallic knocking sound and “hesitation” when accelerating. These may be accompanied by illuminated “oil pressure” and “check engine” warning lights on the dashboard, as well as “burning smell, oil leak or smoke.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent any further damage, the driver should stop the vehicle at the first safe spot and turn off the engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stalling can lead to dangerous situations, especially if it happens in high-speed or dense traffic. A fire inside the engine compartment that occurs while driving has a wide range of potential hazards. Besides the risk of collision, stopping and leaving the vehicle in time may not be possible, which could result in injury or death. There is also a risk of property damage, as the burning vehicle may damage surrounding structures and vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-hybrids-recalled-for-contaminated-battery-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">For tips on what to do in the event of a fire, please refer to the following page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Hyundai recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-issues-fourth-recall-for-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">the newest addition to a long list of fire-related recalls that have been affecting Hyundai and Kia vehicles</a> and is a result of an ongoing investigation into &#8220;non-collision&#8221; fires by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among recent recalls is a Hyundai Sonata recall that happened in December&nbsp; and was caused by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-recalls-over-120000-cars-over-faulty-engines-that-may-catch-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">connection rod bearings issues</a> nearly identical to this one. In January, there was another Hyundai Tucson recall concerning fire risk, although that one was caused by a leaking ABS module.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will address this problem by inspecting the engine for signs of rod bearing damage and replacing the whole engine if needed. In addition, they will update the control software with one that would detect if engines start producing any unusual vibrations. Notifications about the repair will be&nbsp; sent to vehicle owners on November 12, 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle a part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This Hyundai recall includes more than 95,000 vehicles.

The differential is part of both suspension and transmission as transmission drives the rear axles through the differential which is mounted on rear suspension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The carriers in question may be weak due to a manufacturing mistake—the metal casing contains more strontium than it is supposed to. Strontium is an element sometimes added to these aluminum car parts to make them stronger. In this case, too much of this additive&nbsp; has weakened the axle carrier, which could crack or break.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the rear axle carrier fractures, the driver could lose control of the vehicle and crash.

If this happens, the vehicle will suffer from a complete loss of steering, which increases the risk of a crash and injury.&nbsp; This recall includes the following vehicles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2019 Freightliner Cascadia</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Freightliner Cascadia</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Freightliner Cascadia</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On these heavy-duty trucks, <a href=\"https://www.howacarworks.com/basics/how-the-steering-system-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the steering assembly is connected to the front wheels with a pair of drag links</a>. These are metal bars with a ball joint at each end that move the wheel left or right as you steer them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cause of this deficiency involves the ball joint on the drag link, which may not be sufficiently tightened down.  As a result, it may become<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V689000\" target=\"_blank\"> loose over time and completely detach from the steering arm</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In its initial phases, a loose drag link may cause the vehicle steering to become loose or &#8220;off-center.&#8221; Additional warning signs may include vibrations at certain speeds and knocking sounds when turning. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A reduction in steering capabilities makes the vehicle less stable or completely unresponsive, dramatically increasing&nbsp; the chance of a crash or injury. This risk is as severe to the driver and its passengers as it is to other motorists and pedestrians.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Freightliner recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Daimler’s Freightliner Cascadia series trucks continue to be plagued by a cascade of several recent recalls.

This raises the risk of an injury to the child in an accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2021 Volvo V60CC</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Volvo V90</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Volvo V90CC</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Volvo XC40</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Volvo XC40 pure electric</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Volvo XC90</strong></li><li><strong>2021 &#8211; 2022 Volvo XC60</strong></li><li><strong>2021 &#8211; 2022 Volvo S60</strong></li><li><strong>2021 &#8211; 2022 Volvo V60</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of an ongoing recall with multiple manufacturers affected due to faulty parts supplied by Swedish-American manufacturer Autoliv.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanisms called retractors hold seat belts in place. There are two kinds of retractors: Emergency Locking Retractors (ELR) that will allow for the seatbelt to extend with movement freely, but lock in place in the event of sudden deceleration, like if there is a crash; and Automatic Locking Retractors (ALR), which lock in place once it is withdrawn – it only gets tighter and does not extend further – making them a good fit for securing a child seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to faulty parts provided by Autoliv, the ALR function may deactivate and cause the child seat to come loose and move around.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported, child seats reduce deaths by 71% for infants under 1 year old and 54% for kids between 1 and 4 years. If a child seat is not secured correctly, it can seriously increase the risk of injury.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To reduce the risk, parents should use the lower anchors and tethers for children system (LATCH) instead of seat belts while the issue is being fixed, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Owners may realize that the ALR is not working if the clicking noise made when it is activated stops before the seat belt is fully retracted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Background of the recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, this is part of an ongoing series of recalls brought upon by faulty seat belts supplied by Swedish-American supplier Autoliv.
