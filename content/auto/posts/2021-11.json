This recall greatly raises the risk of injury for the occupants of the car and nearby motorists and includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2009 Mazda RX-8</strong></li><li><strong>2010 Mazda RX-8</strong></li><li><strong>2011 Mazda RX-8</strong></li><li><strong>2006 Mazda MazdaSpeed6</strong></li><li><strong>2007 Mazda MazdaSpeed6</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected component is the “fuel pump mounting ring” with part number BN8F42167.  The MazdaSpeed6 vehicles are also known as Mazda6.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicles affected by this recall have a fuel pump mounting ring that may crack, resulting in a fuel leak. The mounting ring is the part that attaches the pump to the fuel tank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V744-1366.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The ring may crack due to improper installation or because of heat coming off the engine and exhaust.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuel that sprays onto hot components in the engine compartment can easily ignite and cause a vehicle fire. This increases the risk of a crash, as flames and smoke may distract drivers and cause them to panic. Another risk is the inability to stop and leave the vehicle in time, leading to an injury or even death. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-issues-fifth-recall-over-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">For tips on what to do in the event of a fire, please visit this article about a recent Hyundai recall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In case of a fuel leak, the owner may smell fuel or notice it under the parked vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Mazda recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The RX-8 and Mazda Mazda6 that are part of this notice are not part of any recent recalls.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, however, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mazda-recalls-vehicles-over-dangerous-airbag-covers/\" target=\"_blank\">manufacturer recalled over 260,000 Mazda3 vehicles due to the risk of airbag cover logos flying off during a collision and hurting the car occupants</a>, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will install a new mounting ring on the affected vehicles to fix the issue.
