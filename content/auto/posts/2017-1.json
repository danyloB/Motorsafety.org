Micro Bird will recall buses from the 2015-2017 model years due to two separate defects.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Drummondville, Canada &#8211; Jan. 24, 2017 &#8211;</em> Corp. Micro Bird Inc., a major&nbsp;manufacturer&nbsp;of school buses, has announced the recall of numerous bus models as a result of multiple defects, affecting bus operation and safety.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Defects</strong></h3>\n<p>Corp. Micro Bird will be recalling model year 2015-2017 Micro Bird T-Series buses. Two groups will be recalled in response to two separate defects. The first includes buses manufactured between Aug. 24, 2015 and Nov. 30, 2016. The second involves&nbsp;those built on Ford chassis and manufactured between Oct. 1, 2014 and Dec. 15, 2016.</p>\n<p>The first group is being recalled as a result of a defective battery-powered wheelchair lift. These lifts contain interlocks that can be deactivated by drivers, allowing the bus to be operated while the lift is down. This may destabilize the buses as they are driven, and may also increase the risk of damage and injury to other nearby vehicles.</p>\n<p>The second&nbsp;recall&nbsp;is&nbsp;in response to defective frame extension adaptors. During an accident, force that is applied to seat belts on seats installed just above the frame extension adapters will put pressure on the adapters, causing them to deform. This, in turn, can increase the chance of injury to passengers.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Events</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nov. 9, 2016 &#8211; Corp. Micro Bird conducted a mandatory test of seats attached to the last rows of the affected buses, located over the frame extensions. During the test, mechanics observed significant damage to the frame extension adapters and the floors of the buses.</li>\n<li>Nov. 11, 2016 &#8211; Corp. Micro Bird received pictures of results of the initial tests. However, they were not clear enough to indicate the specific causes of the damage observed.</li>\n<li>Nov. 23, 2016 &#8211; &nbsp;Bus chassis were sent to a Corp. Micro Bird facility for further inspection. Mechanics determined that the problem was not due to a defect in the specific vehicle, but rather a component design issue that would have affected all buses manufactured during a specific time frame.</li>\n<li>Nov. 30, 2016 &#8211; Meanwhile, another routine inspection of different buses from the same manufacturer noted that some vehicles could be started&nbsp;even when the power-lift switches were in the off position. This prevented the lift from being operated, so that if it was stored it could not be deployed, and if it had been deployed it could not be retracted, even if the bus was moving. The manufacturer decided that this issue presented a safety ris​k that would have to be addressed by the recall process.</li>\n<li>Dec. 8, 2016 &#8211; Corp. Micro Bird decided that the frame extension adapter issue posed a risk to all vehicles with a similar design, and decided that a safety recall would be the most prudent option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>\n<p>Remedy of the powered wheelchair lift issue will be the responsibility of bus owners. Corp. Micro Bird will send materials and all necessary instructions to each owner. This will be done free of charge. Meanwhile, the recall schedule for the frame extension adapter issue has not yet been determined, nor has the specific remedy. The manufacturer plans to release a recall schedule soon, and owners can contact Corp. Micro Bird for more information.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=9529","createdAt":"2017-01-24T04:19:38.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-01-24T17:04:38.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T06:54:48.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T20:39:48.000Z","display_date":"January 24, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shutterstock_153646226-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_153646226-1","category":null,"tags":[],"categories":[]},{"id":9498,"title":"Wheel Hubs May Fail On Volvo Trucks","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wheel-hubs-may-fail-volvo-trucks/","status":"publish","slug":"wheel-hubs-may-fail-volvo-trucks","excerpt":"<p>Volvo will recall several truck models over a wheel hub deficiency.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Jan. 10, 2017 &#8211; Greensboro, N.C. &#8211;</em> Volvo Trucks North America has announced a safety recall of numerous vehicle models due to overloaded wheel hubs that threaten to cause control losses and crashes.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Defect</strong></h3>\n<p>Volvo will recall model year 2017 VHD, VNL and VNM buses&nbsp;manufactured <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2016/RCLRPT-16V927-2040.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">between Feb. 19, 2016 and June 21, 2016</a>, according to documents compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

These air bags can inflate with too much force, rupturing a metal canister and launching shrapnel at drivers and occupants. Honda has said that among those incidents, 10 of the deaths occurred in Honda vehicles between 2009 and 2016.</p>\n<h2><strong>Honda announces additional recalls over air bag defects</strong></h2>\n<p>This week, Honda announced that it will be recalling additional vehicles as a result of defective Takata air bag launchers &#8211;  and not a small number, either.

This week, Ford announced that it would recall 816,000 vehicles for similar air bag issues.</p>\n<p>Of the recalls, about 600,000 were located in the U.S., while the remaining models were located in Canada. All were built in North America. Autoblog reports that <a href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/12/800k-ford-recall-takata-passenger-airbag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the following models will be affected</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2005-09 and 2012 Ford Mustang</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2005-06 Ford GT</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2006-09 and 2012 Ford Fusion</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2007-09 Ford Ranger</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2007-09 Ford Edge</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2006-09 and 2012 Lincoln Zephyr and Lincoln MKZ</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2007-09 Lincoln MKX</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2006-09 Mercury Milan</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ford has not identified any injuries or deaths that occurred in its vehicles as a result of the defects. It has now recalled about 1.3 million vehicles in the U.S., according to Reuters.</p>\n<h2><strong>Government settlement will move forward</strong></h2>\n<p>Earlier this month, there were hints that Takata would agree to settle with the U.S. government over the air bag defects. Now, Reuters has reported that <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-takata-settlement-idUSKBN14W2PZ?il=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this will indeed happen</a>.</p>\n<p>The company has made an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department to pay a $1 billion settlement. This will reportedly be split into multiple parts. About $850 million will be directed toward automakers that were forced to conduct massive recalls. Another $125 million will be directed toward victim compensation. Finally, the last $25 million will take the form of a criminal fine.</p>\n<p>In addition, Takata will be monitored by an independent third party going forward to ensure the problems that led to the defects are addressed.</p>\n<p>Reuters added that Takata may also plead guilty to wire fraud charges, or to providing false test data to U.S. regulators. This is based on information from another settlement in 2015, in which Takata admitted to providing both automakers and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with incomplete or inaccurate data for several years.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of these recalls?</strong></h2>\n<p>Around 1.8 million vehicles were originally part of these recalls. <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 1411939 airbags had been replaced.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:14595,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:10}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=Concatenate(&quot;As of &quot;,R[0]C[4],&quot; – the last date information was available – &quot;,R[0]C[11],&quot; airbags had been replaced.&quot;)\">As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 1,411,939 airbags had been replaced.</span><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021, 958,175 airbags had been replaced, with 400,346 remaining.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:769,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\"> </span>To see if your car still needs to be repaired, use MotorSafety’s<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"> free lookup tool</a>.</p>\n<p><b><i>Note: June 24, 2021</i></b></p>\n<p><i>We have noticed a large number of readers are interested in this recall.

Specifically, this will include&nbsp;PSPI, PSPI-1.1, PSPI-2, PSPI 6, PSPI-L&nbsp;and SPI model inflators. These were not included in any previous recalls.</p>\n<p>The recall will address a significant number of vehicles from multiple automakers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model year 2005-2008 vehicles registered in Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</li>\n<li>Model year 2009 vehicles registered in &nbsp;Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.</li>\n<li>Model year 2012 vehicles registered in the states of Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina&nbsp;and&nbsp;Texas, as well as&nbsp;Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, Fiat Chrysler will recall <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2017-01-06/fiat-chrysler-recalls-100k-vehicles-to-fix-takata-air-bags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more than 100,000</a> trucks and SUVs from the 2009 and 2010 model years that have these inflators installed, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p>\n<p>Takata believes that prolonged exposure to high heat, humidity and multiple temperature swings can cause the propellant in these inflators to degrade. If activated, the inflators may rupture, causing metal fragments to travel through the airbag at high speeds and strike occupants. To date, as many as 16 people have been killed worldwide as a result of this defect, and about 180 have been injured.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Events</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nov. 3, 2015 &#8211; Takata and the NHTSA entered into a consent order to resolve certain issues that had arisen during the ongoing investigation over the defective air bag inflators. The purpose of this order was to further identify and control risks.</li>\n<li>May 4, 2016 &#8211; Takata and the NHTSA amended their consent order, based on recent findings that identified the PSAN inflators as capable of reaching dangerous levels of degradation that could result in shrapnel emanating&nbsp;during launch. The NHTSA ordered Takata to file defect reports.</li>\n<li>May 16, 2016 &#8211; Takata submitted its reports as requested.</li>\n<li>Jan. 3, 2017 &#8211; Takata&nbsp;completed&nbsp;the most recent report, specified by the amended consent order, which deals with the most recent revelations regarding defective air&nbsp;bags.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>\n<p>In many cases, vehicles owners may not be able to have this problem resolved immediately. Takata reports that replacement parts simply aren&#8217;t available for many of the vehicles that have been affected. The manufacturer will work with automakers to ensure each vehicle gets an appropriate remedy, and will communicate with customers so they know to get replacement inflators as soon as they are available. This will be done free of charge.</p>\n<p>In a broader sense, overall resolution of the Takata defects may take many more years. For instance, CNN Money reports that federal safety regulators think it <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/09/autos/takata-airbag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">may take until 2023</a> for all recalled air&nbsp;bags to be repaired. The main challenge is that few recalls address every single affected vehicle &#8211; while the NHTSA considers this to be the goal in this case.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=9325","createdAt":"2017-01-18T04:24:36.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-01-18T10:09:36.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T07:08:24.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T20:53:24.000Z","display_date":"January 18, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":1,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shutterstock_523756342-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_523756342-1","category":null,"tags":[],"categories":[]},{"id":9323,"title":"Pierce Recalls Emergency Vehicles Over Engine Trouble","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/pierce-recalls-emergency-vehicles-engine-trouble/","status":"publish","slug":"pierce-recalls-emergency-vehicles-engine-trouble","excerpt":"<p>Pierce Manufacturing, the maker of emergency vehicles, has announced a recall related to engine trouble.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Appleton, Wis. &#8211; Jan. 17, 2017 &#8211;</em> Pierce Manufacturing, a&nbsp;maker of emergency vehicles, has announced a recall related to engine trouble that could result in an increased risk of fire during operation.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Defect</strong></h3>\n<p>Pierce will be recalling certain model year 2015-2016 Dash emergency vehicles manufactured between Oct. 17, 2014 and Sept. 30, 2016, according to documents compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

In one instance, an improperly fitted connection threatens to make brake pedals less effective over time. In another, faulty axle bolts risk fracture, possibly causing vehicles to lose control during operation.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<p>These issues affect a range of vehicles and will be&nbsp;addressed early in the year.</p>\n<h3><strong>Description of Defects</strong></h3>\n<p>The first defect affects model year 2014 CLA250 vehicles that are equipped with gasoline engines and were manufactured between Dec.&nbsp;14, 2012 and April 24, 2013. According to documents compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, these vehicles contain fittings that connect vacuum lines to brake boosters. These may be poorly fitted and can break during use. If that happens, the brake booster would no longer exist in a vacuum, causing brake force to steadily decrease over time.</p>\n<p>Eventually, as drivers use the brake pedal, brake force would diminish to nothing, severely increasing the risk of control loss and crashes.</p>\n<p>The second defect affects the following seven vehicles models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The model year 2015 GL350 4MATIC BLUETEC with diesel power train.</li>\n<li>The model year 2015 GL450&nbsp;4MATIC with gas power train.</li>\n<li>The model year 2015 GL550 4MATIC with gas power train.</li>\n<li>The model year 2015 and 2016 GL63 AMG 4MATIC with gas power train.</li>\n<li>The model year 2015 ML250 BLUETEC with diesel power train.</li>\n<li>The model year 2015 ML350 with gas power train.</li>\n<li>The model year 2015 ML350 4MATIC with gas power train.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these vehicle models were manufactured between Sept.&nbsp;29, 2014 and March 27, 2015.</p>\n<p>According to NHTSA documents, they all have improperly assembled front and/or rear axle bolts, which risk fracturing during operation. This could leave the vehicles in unstable condition and increase the risk of a serious crash.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Events</strong></h3>\n<p>Brake Defect</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2014: Mercedes-Benz manufacturer Daimler AG initially received field reports of customers experiencing sudden, unexplained brake failure. The manufacturer conducted an initial investigation to determine the source of the problem. It&nbsp;identified&nbsp;the broken connection piece of the brake booster vacuum line in affected vehicles. Months later, Daimler AG had analyzed the break, as well as the production process, but could&nbsp;not determine a cause of the problem.</li>\n<li>2015: The company initiated a Six Sigma Black Belt project late in the year to make another attempt at discovering a cause. This time, the search revealed that there were certain material deficiencies along specific portions of the assembly line, which lead to the defect. Specifically, the application of high levels of force during the assembly process led to weakened components.</li>\n<li>December 2016: Daimler AG determined that a safety risk existed as a result of the defect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Axle Bolt Defect</p>\n<ul>\n<li>April 2016: Two vehicles with weak axle carrier bolts were reported in the Chinese market. Daimler AG launched an investigation and determined that the problem was not the result of an initial production error, but rather that it&nbsp;occurred during a rework.
