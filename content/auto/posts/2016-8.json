A July 2016 bulletin updated the original response method, which includes nine steps. Three of these involve a repeated testing of the ignition key and transmission. This is supposed to help dealers see whether or not they can remove the key in gears aside from park. If the vehicle contains the defect, dealers are instructed to hold it and keep it from further sale.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=8015","createdAt":"2016-08-11T04:18:54.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-08-11T10:03:54.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T04:48:59.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T18:33:59.000Z","display_date":"August 11, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":8,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/shutterstock_1748230262-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1748230262-1","category":{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"}]},{"id":8009,"title":"Lock Issues Affect Several Aston Martin Recalls","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/lock-issues-affect-several-aston-martin-recalls/","status":"publish","slug":"lock-issues-affect-several-aston-martin-recalls","excerpt":"<p>Aston Martin is using it&#8217;s latest auto recalls to address car locks in many models manufactured between 2009-2016.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Gaydon Warwick, U.K. — August 08, 2016 —&nbsp;</em>Several Aston Martin vehicles may not meet&nbsp;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard requirements, according to a recent press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manufacturer will recall 6,076 vehicles with model years ranging from 2010 to 2016 to address ineffective door locks.
