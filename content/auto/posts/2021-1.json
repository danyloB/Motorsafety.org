The inflators, which have killed at least 30 people and caused over 400 injuries, are at the center of the largest auto recall in history, involving 19 car manufacturers and tens of millions of vehicles. Ford and Mazda will have to recall and replace airbags in the following models:</p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2007-2011 Ford Ranger pickups</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2009 Mazda B-Series pickups</strong></li><li><strong>2006-2012 Ford Fusion sedans</strong></li><li><strong>2006-2012 Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ sedans</strong></li><li><strong>2006-2011 Mercury Milan sedans</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2010 Ford Edge SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2010 Lincoln MKX luxury SUVs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The manufacturers have until February 18 to initiate the recall.

Based on that and other factors, in 2017, Ford and Mazda petitioned NHTSA to be excluded from the recall that was initiated by Takata earlier that year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this month, NHTSA denied the petitions due to its and Takata’s analysis of salvaged inflators, which showed that these components still degrade over time, increasing the risk of an explosion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For risks related to this recall, please see our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagen-recalls-over-100000-cars-equipped-with-takata-airbag-inflators/\" target=\"_blank\">recent article about Volkswagen recalling over 100,000 Beetles over similar concerns</a>. Mazda reported injuries related to previous recalls of cars manufactured by the brand but it is not clear how many.

Software issues may cause the screens to turn off, resulting in the driver losing access to essential safety-related&nbsp; information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ask is not an order and gives Tesla the opportunity to conduct a voluntary recall before the agency pursues further action. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The letter and the loss of essential features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 13, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sent a letter to Tesla asking it to recall <strong>2012-2018 Tesla Model S sedans </strong>and <strong>2016-2018 Tesla Model X SUVs. </strong>The move was precipitated by a NHTSA investigation sparked by several thousands of complaints submitted to both the manufacturer and NHTSA directly, alleging issues with the screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conversations with NHTSA the automaker acknowledged that all of the main display screens&nbsp; were expected to fail eventually because the flash memory devices &#8211; that power the screens &#8211; wear out after a certain number of on-off cycles.&nbsp; NHTSA found that their useful life is about five to six years, which is “insufficient” from the safety standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the screens crash, they rob the driver of access to vital safety features, like defrosting, defogging and the backup camera.

According to&nbsp; NHTSA’s letter to Tesla, “the lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the driver’s visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of crash.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Drivers cannot hear alert chimes, such as turn signal “blinker sounds”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The car may no longer make clicking sounds that audibly remind the driver that the turn signal is engaged.

The metal fragments that make up the inflator can hit the car occupants, maiming or killing them.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Auburn Hills, MI – January 4, 202</em>1 – Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) has recalled 105,652 Beetles and Beetle convertibles whose driver-side Takata airbag inflators could explode, hitting the occupants of the vehicle with its potentially lethal metal fragments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the latest in the series of widespread Takata airbag recalls. General Motors and Nissan recently announced their own recalls associated with these dangerous airbags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This round of recalls involves the following model years:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2012 Volkswagen Beetle compact cars, as well as the 2013 and 2014 models</strong></li><li><strong>2012 Volkswagen Beetle convertibles, as well as the 2013 and 2014 models</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cars involved in this ever-growing Takata airbag recall were made with <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/category/takata-airbag-recalls/\">Takata inflators that may blow up during a crash</a> and hurl metal fragments at the driver and passenger, injuring or killing them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The airbags on these Volkswagen Beetle convertible and compact cars are no exception, despite being made with a desiccant, or drying agent, that was designed to prevent moisture &#8211; which is one of the factors in the explosion &#8211; from getting into the airbags.&nbsp; However, while the addition of the drying agent does help, it does not fully prevent these inflators from degrading, resulting in a high risk of an explosion.<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/tk_global_desiccated_psan_summary_report_-_public_final.pdf#page=7\"> The risk becomes higher as the inflators age, according to a study</a> submitted to the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) on behalf of the manufacturers involved in the Takata recall in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s internal efforts failed to show that these airbags were dangerous. However, the manufacturer agreed to recall the cars “out of an abundance of caution.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about the background of the Takata airbag recall, please see the following article about the<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-ordered-to-recall-5-9-million-cars-equipped-with-takata-airbags/\"> </a>recent <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-ordered-to-recall-5-9-million-cars-equipped-with-takata-airbags/\">General Motors recall of Takata airbags</a> that suffered the same issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exploding inflators pose a serious threat to the safety of car occupants. More than 25 people have been killed and at least 250 injured so far in the Takata airbag recall, which has turned into the biggest automotive recalls in U.S. history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report provided by NHTSA to the public about the recall does not furnish any information about injuries associated with this particular Volkswagen recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Additional recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is only the first round of Volkswagen recalls replacing desiccated Takata airbag inflators. The manufacturer has agreed to issue further recalls as vehicles age. The next recall, which will take place in 2023, will include 2015-2016 Volkswagen Beetles and Beetle convertibles. 2017-2019 Beetles and convertibles will be recalled in 2025, along with 2011-2014 Passats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen dealers will <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V785-5351.PDF#page=3\">replace the airbag with one that does not contain ammonium nitrate.</a> The repair is not yet available. Owners will be notified by mail starting February 12, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 100,000 vehicles are included in this Volkswagen recall.
