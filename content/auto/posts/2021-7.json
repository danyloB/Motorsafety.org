The automaker discovered a defect in the lock actuators that would cause the doors to get stuck, sometimes emitting a loud buzzing noise when the car was locked or unlocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not clear how big the population affected by this issue was or how many cars were actually repaired at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many complaints NHTSA received expressed concern that in an emergency or crash, vehicle occupants could become trapped inside the vehicle.&nbsp; This represents a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/bmw-hybrids-recalled-for-contaminated-battery-fire-risk/\" target=\"_blank\">grave risk in the event of, for example, vehicle fires, where occupants need to leave a vehicle quickly</a>.&nbsp; If someone is hurt, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/volkswagen-recalls-audi-sportbacks-for-faulty-wiring/#:~:text=inability%20to%20open%20doors%20from%20the%20outside%20may%20result%20in%20the%20death%20or%20injury%20of%20the%20driver%20and%20passengers%2C%20especially%20if%20they%20are%20incapacitated%20and%20the%20car%20is%20burning.\" target=\"_blank\">first responders may also have a hard time getting to the patient quickly if they cannot open doors from the outside.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>More dangers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the investigation, NHTSA is set to find out how often these rear door failures, confirm the risks that the complaints are referring to and potentially flesh out any additional dangers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigation is currently in the “preliminary evaluation” stage, which NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/downloads/monthlyReports/inv/INVMTY-032019-1234.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">usually completes within four months</a>. If the evaluation shows a potential safety defect, the&nbsp;office will conduct an engineering analysis to decide whether to initiate a safety recall. That stage usually takes around a year, as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Will your vehicle be part of a recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 233,000 vans could be implicated in a future Fiat Chrysler recall or Dodge recall.

This GM recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2020 Buick Encore GX&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Buick Encore GX&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2022 Buick Encore GX&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2021 &#8211; 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected component is “jack assembly,” with multiple part numbers, including 42743996 and 42743997.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The emergency jack is a tool that is used when changing a punctured tire on the side of the road.  After placing it under the appropriate jacking point, the driver uses a lever on the jack to prop up the vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On affected vehicles, if the driver positions the jack incorrectly, it <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V440-2778.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">may collapse while lifting the vehicle</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the manufacturer, defective jacks may collapse only ‘<a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a27274655/how-to-jack-up-car/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">if not positioned as directed in the vehicle owner’s manual</a>’. This scenario is, however, likely to happen when the driver is performing a roadside repair, since these are usually less-than-ideal working conditions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Roadside repairs are dangerous and should be avoided. Always call a tow truck or try to get to an empty parking lot or somewhere where you are not on the side of the road, if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are driving and see a tow truck – or other emergency vehicles – please slow down and move over to the right. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6818213845258027008/\" target=\"_blank\">Over 30 first responders have been killed just this year due to distracted driving</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The plastic jack may not be sturdy enough if positioned incorrectly and collapse under unforeseen loads. This may result in injury to people that are close by or under the vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other General Motors recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different model years of Buick Encore <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-vehicles-recalled-for-potential-fuel-leaks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">were recalled in November of last year because of a potential fluid leak</a>.  Both Buick Encore GX and Chevrolet Trailblazer were part of a separate recall in September of the same year because of potential loss of electronic brake assist. The 2021 Buick Encore has not been subject to any recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, General Motors dealers will replace the plastic emergency jack with a more robust, metal jack. The repair is free of charge. Notifications will be sent to owners around July 26.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These Buick recalls and Chevrolet recalls include more than 135,000 SUVs.

As a result, the driver may think his or her airbag is working properly when it is not and this could result in inadequate protection in the event of a collision.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An airbag is meant to protect the occupant from an upper-body injury and frontal airbags have <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/air-bags\" target=\"_blank\">saved over 50,000 lives in the last 30 years</a>. An airbag that does not deploy in the event of a crash can result in serious injury or even death.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Related complaints</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation over reports concerning airbag malfunctions in General Motor vehicles. <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-under-investigation-for-airbag-failures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Some of the models</a> that are part of this recall were also investigated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of 15 complaints submitted to the NHTSA, six mentioned serious crashes where the airbags failed to deploy. Some also mentioned that the warning lights came on “every two to three minutes when driving.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GM has not commented on whether this recall is a consequence of the investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other GM recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in December 2020, General Motors was ordered to recall <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-ordered-to-recall-5-9-million-cars-equipped-with-takata-airbags/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5.9 million cars with Takata airbags</a> that may rupture when deployed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Chevrolet and Buick recalls in the recent past include the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-recalls-buick-and-chevy-cars-for-suspension-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">January 2021 recall for mid-size sedans</a> over a potential suspension issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The software issue can be resolved with an over-the-air (OTA) update at a dealership. Affected customers will be notified on July 19, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out if your vehicle is a part of this GM recall, use <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\">MotorSafety’s free vehicle lookup tool</a>.</p>\n","source":"https://www.motorsafety.org/?p=110579","createdAt":"2021-07-01T13:36:09.000Z","date_gmt":"2021-07-02T03:21:09.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-22T13:10:58.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-07-23T02:55:58.000Z","display_date":"July 01, 2021","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":36,"name":"Vishal Venugopal","slug":"vishal"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"21V421000","recall_date":"June 3, 2021","meta_title":"GM Recall - 2021 GMC Yukon XL & Corvette Stingray - SDM Programming","meta_description":"GM is recalling various models across GMC, Chevrolet, Buick, & Cadillac including the 2021 Corvette Stingray due to issues with the sensing diagnostic module.","meta_keywords":"GM SDM Programming, GM Recall, Buick Recalls, 2021 GMC Yukon XL, 2021 Corvette Stingray","custom_schema":""},"year":2021,"month":7,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/21V421000-Cadillac-Escalade_rdmip3-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"Black Cadillac Escalade in Showroom","cld_public_id":"21V421000-Cadillac-Escalade_rdmip3","category":{"id":27,"name":"Buick","slug":"buick-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Buick-Logo.png"},"tags":[{"id":2327,"name":"2021 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray","slug":"2021-chevrolet-corvette-stingray"},{"id":745,"name":"Buick Recall","slug":"buick-recall"},{"id":784,"name":"Cadillac Recall","slug":"cadillac-recall"},{"id":786,"name":"Chevrolet Recall","slug":"chevrolet-recall"},{"id":1189,"name":"GM recall","slug":"gm-recall"},{"id":2326,"name":"GM Sensing Diagnostic Module Recall","slug":"gm-sensing-diagnostic-module-recall"},{"id":2168,"name":"GMC recall","slug":"gmc-recall"},{"id":750,"name":"Sensing Diagnostic Module","slug":"sensing-diagnostic-module"}],"categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Buick","slug":"buick-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Buick-Logo.png"},{"id":36,"name":"Cadillac","slug":"cadillac-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cadillac.png"},{"id":12,"name":"Chevrolet","slug":"chevrolet-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chevy_ms.png"},{"id":37,"name":"GM","slug":"gm-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gm.png"},{"id":72,"name":"GMC","slug":"gmc-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmc_RM.png"}]}]
