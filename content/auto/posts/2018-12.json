Toyota estimates that at least 90 percent of the involved vehicles have potential to develop the failed seal condition over the lifetime of the vehicle, which could lead to the unreasonable risk to safety. The potential number of units affected is 44,121.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCLRPT-18V888-1744.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">NHTSA Recall Safety Report</a>, the vehicles contain a brake master cylinder that includes a rubber seal which seals the brake fluid within the housing as the master cylinder piston moves. Due to combinations of improper part machining operations at one supplier facility and casting variations of master cylinders at another of its facilities, there is a possibility that a master cylinder could have an edge that does not have the correct chamfer where the rubber seal is retained. If this were to occur, over time, this edge could damage the rubber seal, causing an internal fluid leak. If the vehicle continues to be operated in this condition, the brake pedal feel could change, and front brake performance could be suddenly reduced. Reduced front braking performance could increase the vehicle stopping distance and may increase the risk of a crash.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RMISC-18V888-7095.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">chronology report</a>&nbsp;issued by Toyota, in June 2018, Toyota received three field reports on 2018 Tacoma vehicles which described the brake pedal traveling to the floor and reduced braking ability. All three of these vehicles had less than 600 miles. The brake master cylinders were recovered and sent to the part supplier for investigation. In August, Toyota received additional field reports of this condition, which master cylinders were also recovered and sent to the supplier for investigation. In September, the part supplier began providing its preliminary analysis based on some of the recovered parts. This preliminary analysis indicated that an internal leak existed which was caused by a cut rubber seal, and it was observed in these cases that the channel within the bore of the master cylinder, which is designed to retain the rubber seal, had an edge that did not have the correct chamfer.</p>\n<p>Between October 2018 – early December 2018, the part supplier reported that their testing had identified multiple improper processes completed at the U.S. machining facility. When some combination of these improper processes were applied to non-concentric castings from the supplier casting facility in Japan, there existed a possibility of producing master cylinders with edges at the channel of the bore with varying levels of incorrect chamfer. It was also determined that this would only occur on parts cast in the supplier&#8217;s Japan facility and machined at the supplier&#8217;s U.S. facility.</p>\n<p>Additional testing on newly machined master cylinders with edges of different incorrect chamfers revealed that the seals in a number of these tests were damaged and may eventually result in an internal leak. Any parts which were cast in the supplier&#8217;s Japan facility and machined in the supplier&#8217;s U.S. facility during the production range preceding identification of a potential issue may have some level of incorrect chamfer which may damage the seal.</p>\n<p>It was determined that a damaged seal could cause brake fluid to leak internally, causing the brake pedal feel to change, and front brake performance could be suddenly reduced. On December 7, 2018, based on the results of the above investigation, Toyota decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall campaign. As of December 3, 2018, Toyota was only aware of 5 Toyota Field Technical Reports (3 unconfirmed reports) and 37 warranty claims (28 unverified claims) received from U.S. sources which were considered in the recall decision. Toyota is unaware of any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>All known owners of the involved vehicles will be notified via first class mail to return their vehicles to a Toyota dealer. Toyota dealers will replace the brake master cylinder with a new one, free of charge. As the owner notification letters will be mailed out well within the active period of the Toyota New Vehicle Limited Warranty (&#8220;Warranty&#8221;), all involved vehicle owners for this recall would have been provided a repair at no cost under Toyota&#8217;s Warranty. The recall is expected to begin January 21, 2019. Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-888-270-9371. Toyota&#8217;s numbers for this recall are J16/J06. Owners may also call the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153).

The potential number of units affected is 104,663.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the NHTSA Recall Safety Report, Daimler AG, the manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, has determined that certain C-Class and GLC vehicles (205 and 253 platforms) which have been equipped with Audio 20 head units and automatic child seat recognition, could have a potential safety risk.</p>\n<p>Due to a signal logic error, the status of the passenger side airbags may display incorrectly in the center console, resulting in the user failing to be informed correctly about the actual activation status of the passenger side airbags. A potential false passenger classification could increase the risk of injury for the passenger in case of a crash, and with an incorrect activation status shown, the user will not be warned to correct the situation for maximum safety.</p>\n<p>If the passenger air bag is incorrectly displayed as &#8216;ON&#8217; when it is not, both the driver and the front seat passenger may be unaware that the air bag will not deploy in the event of a crash, increasing their risk of injury. While there is a chance that the customer may be made aware of the issue by an incorrect display of the passenger airbag status (such as both on and off lights glowing), in other cases the customer will not receive an advance warning due to the nature of issue (the incorrect light glowing).</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In late February 2018, DAG launched initial investigations based on an isolated field report which described a condition in which both the airbag off and on light were displayed at the same time. In March 2018, a second vehicle showed similar symptoms in the field, and was requested by DAG for further analysis. By late April 2018, these analyses indicated that there was a potential signal logic error between the seat mat, the head unit, and the display in the center console on the second vehicle. In May 2018, subsequent analyses were begun in an attempt to identify a possible root cause for the error.</p>\n<p>In June and July 2018, analyses results pointed to a potential timing issue of the head unit. In August 2018, DAG and the supplier performed further testing, and the potential for both lights to be displayed at the same time, and also an incorrect light to be displayed, was confirmed. In September 2018, the potential consequences of an incorrect display of the passenger airbag status were analyzed, and in October 2018, a plant action was launched to rework first, all affected vehicles within reach of the plant at that time, and second, to rework potentially affected vehicles in the field as they were identified. In November 2018, DAG determined that the possibility of a potential safety risk existing could not be definitively ruled out and issued the recall. A change of the head unit software ensured that this issue could no longer occur from October 12, 2018, onwards.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>MBUSA will notify owners, and dealers will update the audio head unit software, free of charge. All involved vehicles remain covered under the new vehicle warranty. The recall is expected to begin January 2, 2019. Owners may contact MBUSA customer service at 1-800-367-6372.

The potential number of units affected is 6,162.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCLRPT-18V850-1481.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">NHTSA Recall Safety Report</a>, Daimler AG (&#8220;DAG&#8221;), the manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, determined that on certain vehicles with rear-wheel drive, a locknut in the steering rack might have internal material cracks. Additionally, six vehicles were identified as having been previously repaired using the affected locknut. In the unlikely event that such a locknut was installed in the affected vehicle population, large lateral forces, such as those encountered by impacting a curb during maneuvering or parking, could cause the locknut to break. This could also cause the steering to become fixed in a static position, which would increase the risk of a crash.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In February 2018, the supplier of the steering rack informed DAG about instances of broken locknuts in the supplier&#8217;s production process. Subsequently, DAG launched investigations of this issue together with the supplier. It was determined that the material of a certain batch of locknuts might have internal cracks due to a process deviation at a sub-supplier, and it was concluded that locknuts exhibiting this issue would be identified in the production process of the supplier by the installed quality inspections and application of defined loads and forces to the steering racks in the production process. These conclusions were confirmed by additional high-stress load testing of potentially affected locknuts.</p>\n<p>After this investigation was completed, DAG determined in March 2018 that no safety relevance for this issue existed, as all potentially affected locknuts or steering racks would be identified in the supplier&#8217;s production process. However, in June 2018, DAG was informed about an instance of a fixed steering assembly during unloading of a new vehicle at a dealer in Asia. The steering rack of this vehicle was shipped to the supplier for investigation and in mid-July 2018 a broken locknut was identified as the root cause. Subsequently, the investigation of the aforementioned issue was re-opened in order to clarify why the locknut was not identified as faulty during the production process of the supplier.</p>\n<p>Between August and September 2018, it was concluded that the locknut in question had internal cracks in the material, thus making it impossible for those cracks to be detected by the installed quality inspections at the supplier. Until then, it was assumed that all cracks would be visible on the surface and thus be detectable by the installed magnetic particle testing. Furthermore, it was concluded that the existing conformity-of-production tests that apply defined forces to each steering rack might not in every case lead to a detection of an affected locknut in the supplier&#8217;s production process.</p>\n<p>In October 2018, further testing was carried out to analyze the forces potentially occurring during vehicle operation as well as the speeds and driving situations under which such forces might occur. It was concluded that a breakage of an affected locknut would only occur under maximum forces acting on the steering rack. Such forces typically appear in case of contact with the curb during parking or maneuvering of the vehicle. These driving situations usually occur at low speeds. At the same time, the range of potentially affected vehicles was determined by analyzing logistics documents of the complete supply chain.</p>\n<p>In November 2018, DAG determined that a potential safety risk cannot be ruled out, and voluntarily issued a recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>As a precautionary measure an authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer will replace the steering rack on the affected vehicles. The steering racks to be installed in the scope of the recall contain locknuts which meet production specifications. MBUSA does not plan to provide notice about pre-notice reimbursement to owners since all involved vehicles remain covered under the new vehicle warranty.

The potential number of units affected is 403.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCLRPT-18V848-9837.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">NHTSA Recall Safety Report</a>, supplier manufacturing records identified a specific production period of right front roof side rails affected by an improper manufacturing process. Affected vehicles may have larger-than-specified mounting holes for the clip that secures the right center pillar garnish. In the event of a crash necessitating right side curtain airbag deployment, the clip may not hold the center pillar garnish in position and may potentially interfere with curtain airbag deployment. In the event of a crash, if the curtain air bag does not deploy as intended, it can increase the risk of injury.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On October 23, 2018, a loose right center pillar garnish was discovered during vehicle assembly, prompting a hold and stop shipment to be placed on all vehicles while an inquiry was made to the supplier. The supplier informed Honda that a recent repair to the die mold that punches the mounting hole for the right center pillar garnish clip was inappropriate, resulting in burrs in the sheet metal. These burrs were removed with grinding tools, which inadvertently increased the diameter of the mounting hole.</p>\n<p>On October 24, 2018, with the suspect range of parts identified and manufacturing errors corrected by the supplier, Honda measured the retention force of all suspect right center pillar garnish clips. The vehicles with right center pillar garnish clips that met the retention force specification were released from hold. Honda investigated the potential consequences of a loose right center pillar garnish clip, and on November 20, 2018, Honda determined that the potential for FMVSS noncompliance existed and decided to conduct a safety recall.</p>\n<p>As of November 20, 2018 Honda had not received any warranty claims, field reports, nor reports of crashes or injuries related to this issue.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Honda will notify owners, and dealers will install a bracket on the right center pillar that will securely hold the center pillar trim clip, free of charge. Because the limited new vehicle warranty on all affected vehicles would have provided a free repair for the problem addressed by this recall, without any payment by the owner, reimbursement for pre-notification repairs will not be offered. The recall is expected to begin January 25, 2019. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138. Honda&#8217;s number for this recall is D3D.

Repeated high-energy clutch slip input can lead to premature clutch lining wear, and this can subsequently cause a reduction in the mechanical properties of pressure plate material. After repeated cyclic heating and cooling events, cracks may develop around the outer edge of the pressure plate.</p>\n<p>The torque capacity reduction that occurs due to clutch lining wear can cause additional slippage and introduce excessive energy and heat into the pressure plate. Eventually, a structural failure or fracture of the pressure plate may occur, leading to clutch cover and transmission housing breaches, which can potentially cause a leak of transmission fluid. A transmission fluid leak in the presence of an ignition source such as hot engine or exhaust components can increase the risk of a fire in the engine compartment.</p>\n<p>Vehicle operators may notice clutch odor and smoke, and reduced vehicle performance, which are indications of a potential clutch slip condition prior to pressure plate fracture.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>As part of an earlier recall, Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee approved field action 18S07 (18V169) March 5, 2018. Between April and August 2018, Ford of Europe continued to monitor field data related to the subject vehicles, and between September and October 2018, a review of field data identified two reports of clutch pressure plate damage on European vehicles. Of these, one vehicle was equipped with a 1.5L and one equipped with a 1.0L engine and B6 manual transmission. Both were built after the timeframe for the previous field action.</p>\n<p>Additional engineering investigation and testing identified a wider suspect population of vehicles built with clutch pressure plates manufactured after the field action but prior to a February 2018 material change to the clutch pressure plate. Ford of Europe&#8217;s Critical Concern Review Group reviewed this issue on October 10, 2018.</p>\n<p>Analysis of field data for U.S. vehicles equipped with the B6 manual transmission identified no reports of pressure plate damage on vehicles built after the timeframe for the previous field action, but on November 19, 2018, Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee reviewed the concern and approved an incremental population of 2,828 vehicles to 18S07 due to two reports of underhood fire on vehicles with similar transmissions in Europe &#8211; although no reports have been made in the U.S. for any similar problems.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford will notify owners, and dealers will update vehicles with software that detects and prevents prolonged clutch slip, and will replace the clutch, as necessary, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin January 7, 2019. Owners may contact Ford at 1-866-436-7332. Ford&#8217;s number for this recall is 18S07.

(Volkswagen) is recalling certain 2018 Audi A5 Sportback and 2017-2018 Audi A4 all-road vehicles due to potential, improperly tightened airbag module mounting screws. The potential number of units affected is 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The defect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCLRPT-18V836-5476.PDF\">NHTSA Recall Safety Report</a>, one of the four passenger airbag module mounting screws may not have been torqued to the correct specification during production. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a crash with passenger airbag deployment, an improperly torqued screw may cause the airbag housing in the instrument cluster to deform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can change how the airbag unfolds during deployment and result in the airbag not providing protection as intended, leading to an increased risk of injury to the front passenger seat occupant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Timeline of events</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 25, 2018, the Audi Product Safety Committee was informed that road vehicle testing showed abnormalities in passenger airbag mounting screw connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between October and November 2018, the issue was evaluated. This process included detailed testing and investigation regarding root cause, impact, scope and affected vehicles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall condition was determined to be the result of human error during passenger airbag assembly. All affected vehicles can be traced to airbag assembly by one factory employee. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall population was determined by reviewing screw data logs and samples tests. On all other (unaffected) vehicles, the screw connection was tightened properly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 19, 2018, the Audi Product Safety Committee made a determination of a safety defect and decided to conduct a safety recall. The relevant tool for airbag mounting has been modified so that this type of error cannot occur in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen will notify owners and dealers in mid-January, and the affected passenger airbag screw connection will be inspected and, if necessary, correctly tightened to the required torque specification. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the screw will be replaced if necessary, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin January 26, 2019.

The potential number of units affected is 1,152.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2018/RCLRPT-18V833-6912.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NHTSA Recall Safety Report</a>, The Engine Control Unit (ECU) software may erase trouble codes after the ignition is turned off, not illuminating warning lamps and preventing drivers from being warned of safety system problems the next time that they are driving. If the warning lamps do not indicate a safety system failure such as an engine or fuel injection system malfunction, continuing to drive the vehicle with a faulty system and no warning can increase the risk of a crash or injury.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>In late 2017, Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. received multiple field complaints stating that affected vehicles were failing to pass the smog test. This increase in field complaints (including cases where warning/error messages were spontaneously disappearing from fault memory) led to Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. launching an investigation in early 2018 to determine the alleged malfunction and its root cause. Results from the investigation revealed a faulty reflash procedure for this model (key off / key on cycle), with consequent risk of trouble codes not properly stored in the system memory after each key off. It was assumed based on this issue that relevant fault codes could also not be stored, and in November 2018 the matter was presented at the Product Safety Committee whereupon the decision to conduct a safety recall was made. Production for the involved model had already reached the end of its life cycle, therefore no production correction action was necessary.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. will notify all owners of affected vehicles and will instruct them to arrange for an appointment with an authorized Lamborghini dealer. Dealers will reflash the engine software with appropriate procedure free of charge. The rightly reflashed engine software correctly stores errors detected by the system and renders the software suitable to pass the smog test. The recall is expected to begin December 14,2018. Owners may contact Lamborghini customer service at 1-866-681-6276. Lamborghini&#8217;s number for this recall is L61XR0118.
