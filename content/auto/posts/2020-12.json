The seat belt may not properly secure the occupant in the seat, increasing the risk of injury in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2019-2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trucks</strong></li><li><strong>2019-2021 GMC Sierra 1500 trucks</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Chevrolet Suburban SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Chevrolet Tahoe SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2021 GMC Yukon XL SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2020-2021 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 trucks</strong></li><li><strong>2020-2021 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 trucks</strong></li><li><strong>2020-2021 GMC Sierra 2500 trucks</strong></li><li><strong>2020-2021 GMC Sierra 3500 trucks</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seat belt brackets are designed to secure the seat belt to the seat frame. In recalled vehicles, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"the supplier of the front-row center seat failed to attach the brackets to the frame of the seat correctly (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V792-6422.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">the supplier of the front-row center seat failed to attach the brackets to the frame of the seat correctly</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the seat belt may be “loose or detached from the seat frame.” Passengers may also hear a rattling sound emanating from the seat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue was first caught by the manufacturer in August 2020. There are no injuries associated with this recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other GM recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>December saw a GMC Sierra and Chevy Silverado recall due to an issue with roof-rail airbags, as well as a massive, six-million car recall <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-ordered-to-recall-5-9-million-cars-equipped-with-takata-airbags/\" target=\"_blank\">due to faulty Takata airbags’ inflators that are prone to hurling “sharp metal fragments”</a> into the car occupants in a crash. The latter includes Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe SUVs. However, the trucks involved in both recalls are older models and not the same ones that are being recalled this time around.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks </strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Motor <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/seatbelts/facts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death among those aged 1-54 </a>in the U.S.”  Seat belts can sharply reduce the risk of death or injury in a crash but they must be able to secure each occupant in the vehicle. If not, the passenger or the driver may be injured inside the vehicle or thrown from the vehicle during a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, dealers must inspect the seat belt bracket attachments on both sides of the front-row center seat and will reassemble them as necessary. The repair will be free of charge.&nbsp; General Motors expects to begin the recall on February 1, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 624,000 vehicles are included in this General Motors recall.

The recall was performed in three groups in January 2021 through February 2021. A similar <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/honda-recalls-vehicles-defective-driveshafts/\">problem with the driveshaft occurred in 2017 on Honda Civic Sedans vehicles</a> produced between August and September 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Torrance, CA – December 23, 2020</em> – Honda (NYSE: HMC) is recalling 210,000 vehicles in the so-called “salt belt” whose drive shafts &#8211; which transfers power to the wheels &#8211; may become corroded and break.

Salt can be very corrosive to the underside of vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recalled vehicles’ drive shafts are supposed to have a protective coating, but due to a manufacturing error, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCRIT-20V770-5597.pdf\">the paint on the driveshaft may peel and chip over time and potentially cause corrosion,</a> due to exposed bare metal . Left unprotected, road salt can eat away at the driveshaft and cause it to break. As a result, and similar to the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-explorers-and-aviators-over-fractured-driveshafts/\">2020 Ford Explorer, the vehicle may stall or roll away when parked.</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other ‘salty’ recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-explorers-for-third-time-due-to-faulty-suspension/\">Salt was also the culprit of a recent Ford recall of its 2013-2017 Explorer SUVs.</a> In that case, the substance corroded the bottom of the vehicles and caused their toe links &#8211; which form part of them and ensure that the cars go in the right direction &#8211; to snap. In May of last year,<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/2011-2013-mazda6-under-recall-due-to-corrosion/\"> Mazda also pulled close to 50,000 cars off the market</a> to replace faulty parts that could result in a loss of power steering.

Vehicles with a broken driveshaft could also roll away if parked on a slope without engaging the emergency brake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of November 24, 2020, 152 owners have sent Honda warranty claims relating to this issue.

The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>2014-2016 Ford Explorer SUVs</strong></li><li>&nbsp;<strong>2014-2015 Ford Taurus sedans</strong></li><li>&nbsp;<strong>2014-2016 Ford Edge SUVs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a Ford press release from November 13 mentions that the 2016 Taurus is also part of the recall and that only 2014 Edge SUVs are included. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a design error, the bracket may not withstand the vehicle&#8217;s normal vibration. This could cause the bracket to crack. Because the bracket connects the engine to <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-f-250s-and-f-350s-for-front-axle-issues/\">the front axle &#8211; which transmits the power from the vehicle to its wheels</a> &#8211; this defect can cause a loss of “motive power” or “park function.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Ford Explorer, Edge and Taurus recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several Ford Explorer recalls outstanding. In November, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-explorers-for-third-time-due-to-faulty-suspension/\">2013-2017 Explorers were recalled for the third time due to a faulty suspension</a>, as reported. 2020 Explorer SUVs and Edge SUVs were also recalled in September <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-vehicles-with-distorted-rearview-camera-image/\">due to rearview cameras that may display a “distorted or blank” image,</a><strong> </strong>also as reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2015-2018 Ford Edge cars were recalled for leaking brake fluid&nbsp; in August, while Ford Taurus sedans were subject to a recall in February due to toe link problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drivers in the recalled cars face a number of risks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If the vehicle does not stay in park, the unexpected movement may cause a rollaway incident or an accident. The vehicle may roll into a person, another vehicle or a traffic lane.</li><li>A loss of power may prevent a driver from accelerating to merge into traffic and cause an accident.</li><li>Damage to other component parts may also cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle and lead to an accident.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the link shaft brackets cracks, drivers may notice “grinding, banging or clicking noise from the driveline” while driving, according to NHTSA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, dealers will need to replace the link shaft bracket. The repair is free of charge, but the parts are not currently available. Ford sent owners an interim notification which explained the recall on November 30, 2020. Each owner will receive a second notification when parts are available for the repair.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 15,500 vehicles are included in this Ford recall.

There it may interact with hydrocarbons and air in an area called the intake manifold, which forms part of the engine. This may lead to an engine fire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time Chrysler’s cars are having issues with EGR coolers. In 2019, Chrysler recalled a number of Ram 1500 trucks for the same EGR cooler issue. This past August a number of owners filed a class action lawsuit, alleging that the manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/news/botched-class-action-alleges-fca-left-dodge-ram-1500-drivers-high-and-dry-with-recall-over-engine-fire-risk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">“botched” the recall, not making enough parts available for replacement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle fires are not uncommon. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/US-Fire-Problem/osvehiclefires.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">It is estimated that 212,500 vehicle fires occurred in 2018</a>, causing 560 deaths, 1,500 injuries and $1.9 billion in property damage. If the EGR cooler issues cause a fire, the driver will receive very little warning. If you suspect that there is a fire in your engine compartment, pull over, turn off the vehicle, move all occupants out and away from it and call 911.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, dealers will replace the EGR cooler. They will also inspect the intake manifold and replace that as well if necessary. The repair is free of charge. This Jeep Grand Cherokee recall is expected to begin on December 31, 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 28,000 vehicles are included in this Jeep Cherokee recall.

The following numbered Toyota parts are affected:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>195140201</strong></li><li><strong>195140222</strong></li><li><strong>195140249</strong></li><li><strong>291100043</strong></li><li><strong>291200100</strong></li><li><strong>291200200</strong></li><li><strong>291200202</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall concerns the fuel pump, which is responsible for moving gas from a car’s tank to its engine. The fuel pumps in question have a small plastic turbine called an impeller that sucks gas through the pump. These impellers may have been manufactured in a way that <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20E026-9188.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">causes them to weaken and deform as they soak in fuel</a>. This may cause the whole pump to stop working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Series of Denso recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall is the latest in a series issued by automakers who installed Denso pumps in their vehicles. In the United States, Subaru, Toyota and Honda have issued recalls. According to documents Denso submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Ford, Mazda and Mitsubishi also purchased faulty fuel pumps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toyota issued their first Denso fuel pump recall in January for nearly 700,000 vehicles. Less than a month later, a class action lawsuit was proposed in the Eastern District of New York which <a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/news/class-action-says-jan.-2020-toyota-lexus-denso-fuel-pump-recall-left-out-affected-2018-2019-vehicles#embedded-document\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">complained that the initial Toyota recall was too small, and left out cars that were built with the same defective pump</a>. Toyota <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCMN-20V682-5899.pdf#page=3\">has since expanded the recall two times,</a> and by the end of October they had recalled nearly 3.35 million vehicles in total.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A car that stalls while in motion is at a high risk of getting hit from behind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denso has warned in recall documents that vehicles may stall while driving. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V012-4479.PDF#page=11\" target=\"_blank\">Drivers should keep an eye on the check engine light and other warning indicators</a>.

If it is anything like the previous Toyota recalls of Denso fuel pumps, Toyota will notify owners and dealers will replace the fuel pump assembly with a nondefective one for free. Toyota owners were only notified of the prior recall on November 23, but the remedy has not yet become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 1.5 million vehicles have been added to this Denso recall.

This recall was announced alongside a Tesla steering bolt recall of <strong>2020 Model Y.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp; recall concerns two panels, or “appliques,” on the roof of the Model X—one behind the windshield and the other between the falcon doors—that may fall off while the car is in motion. The panels are attached to the SUV using urethane adhesive. With many strong glues, it is important to use a primer to make sure the glue sticks to the surfaces it’s joining. Tesla believes its applique supplier was inconsistent in how it primed the panels, and that this is why some of them are falling off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla said it first became aware of the issue on September 21, 2020, but owners have been posting images of their <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/444149/tesla-model-x-loses-roof/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">detached Model X roof panels </a>on Tesla forums since at least June 2019. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) received four driver complaints, starting in August 2017, of roof panels detaching from the 2016 Model X.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In its filing with NHTSA, Tesla admits that “if the applique separates from the vehicle while in drive, it could create a road hazard for following motorists and increase their risk of injury or a crash.” Tesla has received no reports of injuries or accidents caused by fly-away appliques, but the danger was obvious to one driver of a 2016 Model X who reported <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=11014094\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">seeing a “top glass piece” (actually shiny plastic) that flew off the car “at freeway speeds</a>. Not good.” The report, filed with the NHTSA, added that the piece&nbsp; “could easily have killed someone in another car.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The dangers of road debris</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Road debris is one of the top causes of injuries and deaths. For our previous reporting on the topic, please check out <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/land-rover-recalls-range-rover-sport-suvs-for-fly-away-spoilers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">this page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Owners may be able to see these panels separating from the roof, or they may hear a noise as wind causes the panel to vibrate against the car. Even if there are no signs of detachment, owners should take recalled vehicles to a dealer, who will test whether the panels in question are firmly attached. If they fail the test, the dealer will apply primer and attach the panels to the car properly, free of charge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla has not yet reported to NHTSA when they expect this recall to begin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 9,000 vehicles are included in this Tesla recall.

As happened in 2020 with the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/kia-sedona-minivans-recalled-for-potential-fire-hazard/\">Kia Sedona Minivans, engine oil may be leaking through a faulty rubber gasket on the engine cylinder</a>, where it could drip on the car’s alternator, disabling it. Without the alternator, the car cannot charge itself while running, which will eventually result in a stall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NHTSA determined that 1% of the vehicles repaired during the first recall went on to have oil leaks due to mistakes made by the dealers during the previous round of repairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though Hyundai says it knows of no crashes or injuries caused by these failing alternators, stalling does raise the risk of accidents, injuries, and worse. Veracruz drivers should keep an eye on the airbag, battery, and check engine warning lights, which may illuminate if the alternator is in trouble. Even if the vehicle does not stall, drivers may notice their cars surging or hesitating as the charging system dies.&nbsp; Here are some <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/fiat-chrysler-recalls-grand-cherokees-and-1500s-with-stalling-risk/\">tips on what to do if your car stalls</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Hyundai recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-recalls-more-than-8000-santa-fe-vehicles-for-faulty-airbags/\">Hyundai Motor America (Hyundai) recalled certain 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe vehicles for airbags issues</a>.

The infamous airbag inflators have already killed 27 people and injured at least 250 more, and are part of the largest auto recall in history. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The latest installment of the recall (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/gm-denial_of_consolidated_petition_nhtsa-2016-0124_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The latest installment of the recall</a> &#8211; which already encompasses 19 car manufacturers and “tens of millions” of cars &#8211; includes the following GM models on the GMT900 platform:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2007-2014 Cadillac Escalade ESV and EXT SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2014 Chevrolet Avalanche pickups</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and 2500/3500 pickups</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2014 Chevrolet Suburban SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2014 Chevrolet Tahoe SUVs</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2014 GMC Sierra 1500 and 2500/3500 pickups</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2014 GMC Yukon XL SUVs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall concerns the vehicles’ passenger-side airbag inflators. The inflators use ammonium nitrate to generate a small explosion to inflate the airbags. If this volatile chemical is exposed to heat and humidity, it becomes porous. The extra surface area in this microscopic swiss-cheese allows the ammonium nitrate to burn faster, thus causing a much stronger explosion than intended. This explosion can blow up the inflator and send bits of shrapnel flying into vehicle occupants at high speeds, potentially maiming or killing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NHTSA first ordered GM to recall the affected cars in 2016. The company had recalled 330,198 vehicles on the GMT900 platform in May 2015, but argued that the rest of vehicles that are now being recalled should be excluded because the airbag defect was “inconsequential.” This argument was rejected by NHTSA on November 23. Despite disagreeing with the decision,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/general-motors-statement-in-response-to-nhtsa-denying-gms-petitions-requesting-nhtsa-exclude-certain-gm-trucks-and-suvs-from-the-takata-airbag-inflator-recalls-301178958.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">GM said it would not appeal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>‘Almost no data’ to back up claims</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NHTSA consulted air-bag chemical expert Harold Blomquist regarding these findings, who rebutted GM’s many claims that unique design features could prevent their inflators from exploding. “GM expended little effort over the last two years to methodically study the claimed features in order to substantiate their effectiveness,” he said in his <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"75-page review of GM’s petition (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/exhibit_a-blomquist_report_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">75-page review of GM’s petition</a>. As a result, Blomquist said, GM had “almost no data” to back up their claims that their Takata airbags were somehow less dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Previous Takata airbag recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automakers have been issuing ever-expanding recalls of <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/?s=takata\">Takata airbags</a> for seven years, with 100 million inflators recalled worldwide. Volkswagen, BMW and Honda all recalled cars this and past year because of the airbag issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GM will replace the Takata airbags with a different model, free of charge. More information about the recall schedule should be released by December 24.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What to do if you own a recalled vehicle</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NHTSA has issued a few broad recommendations for drivers in the Takata recall population:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Don’t have your dealer disable your airbags.</strong> “It is much more likely that your airbag will perform properly and protect you in a crash than cause harm,” NHTSA says.</li><li>“If you feel uncomfortable continuing to drive your vehicle before it is repaired, you should <strong>contact your dealer to see if they will provide a loaner</strong> until the repair is completed,” NHTSA says.

The driveshaft could break, resulting in a host of complications, including the risk of fire.</p>\n","description":"\n<p>Pleasanton, CA – December 1, 2020 – Ford (NYSE: F) <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V693\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">is recalling</a> 10,905 <strong>2020 Ford Explorer</strong> and<strong> Lincoln Aviator SUVs</strong> whose driveshafts &#8211; one of the most important components of a car &#8211; may fracture, presenting several risks including vehicle rollaway, fuel leaks and fire. All of the recalled vehicles have 10-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel drive, and 2.0L or 3.3L engines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In approximately 18 of the 10,905 recalled vehicles, the rear driveshaft may not have been welded properly and could snap. The driveshaft transfers power to the rear wheels. Its breakage could cause the vehicle to lose power while in motion or roll away when parked. The snapped shaft could also pierce the fuel tank and cause a leak and/or fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford knows the serial numbers of the faulty driveshafts, but they must inspect over 10,000 vehicles to find them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020 Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator have had close to a dozen of&nbsp; combined recalls since August 2019, including one for <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-vehicles-with-distorted-rearview-camera-image/\">malfunctioning rearview camera</a> and another one for <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-motor-company-recalls-certain-2020-explorer-and-lincoln-aviator-vehicles/\">defective fuel lines</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The broken driveshaft can cause a whole host of problems. A snapped driveshaft will cut off drive power to the rear wheels, increasing the risk of a crash because of unexpected movement. The vehicle could also roll away if parked on a hill. This is what killed actor <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalls-67248-jeep-cherokees-over-risk-of-stalling-and-rollaway/\">Anton Yelchin</a>, whose Jeep Cherokee (also recalled) rolled down his driveway and crushed him against a pillar.&nbsp; Furthermore, if the driveshaft snaps, it could hit the fuel tank and spring a leak, which in turn could lead to a fire. It’s a frightening list of potential scenarios that should encourage owners to get their vehicles looked at.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will inspect the driveshaft and check its serial number. If it matches one on Ford’s list of affected serial numbers, they will replace the driveshaft. Ford plans to notify owners by mail during the week of November 30 as to when the repair will be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 10,000 cars are included in this Ford recall.
