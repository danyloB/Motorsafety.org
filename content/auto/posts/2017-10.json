The campaign affects 2015-2017 Maserati Quattroporte luxury sports sedans with eight-valve engines. The Italian automaker suspects 100 percent of the models referenced in this action contain defective parts.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>The vehicles involved in this recall contain low-pressure fuel pump resistors that could fail unexpectedly due to cycle time and temperature fatigue. In the event that failure occurs, the fuel pump ceases operation and the engine stalls. This poses a serious threat to occupants, as sudden fuel pump failure can increase the likelihood of an accident. That said, Maserati has not received reports linking the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>On July 11, 2017, a Japanese parts provider responsible for supporting Maserati production operations informed the car company that local government officials had conducted a vehicle warranty claims audit and found that 11 Quattroporte had filed reports detailing instances of fuel pump resistor failure. Maserati immediately launched an internal investigation into the claims. Engineers conducted a global claims analysis and found that 119 additional owners had filed similar reports worldwide. Most of the vehicles mentioned in these documents experienced fuel pump resistor failure at the 19,500-mile mark.</p>\n<p>In late July, the car company conducted a parts analysis on the defective fuel pump resistors and found that high temperature and current flow were the root causes of failure. The fixtures were designed to handle a maximum current of 15 amps and at a temperature of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit. Those installed in the vehicles referenced in the reports routinely experienced current flows of 14 amps, combined with temperatures exceeding 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>After reviewing this and other data, Maserati quality and safety personnel decided to conduct a voluntary recall Sept. 22.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The car company will direct dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V610-4222.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replace the fuel pump resistors</a> in affected models free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgment document from the NHTSA. Maserati plans to notify both dealers and owners of the action Nov. 13, 2017. Those in need of more immediate assistance can contact Maserati customer service representatives at (201) 510-2369.

The campaign affects 2017 Kia Sorento&nbsp;sport utility vehicles with production dates ranging from March 27, 2017 to March 30, 2017. KMA suspects roughly one-quarter of the models named in the recall actually contain the defective components.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles may include improperly heat treated crankshafts prone to failure. As a result, models with these fixtures in place can stall or catch fair with little to no warning. This poses a serious risk to occupants &#8211; especially those traveling at high speeds. However, KMA has yet to receive reports linking the defective crankshafts to any accidents.</p>\n<p>Owners driving Sorento SUVs that include the problematic components have reported hearing cyclical knocking and seeing their check-engine lights illuminated. KMA advises owners to discontinue vehicle operation as soon as they experience symptoms of the defect, as stalling or engine fires tend to develop quickly following crankshaft failure.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On July 5, 2017, a customer contacted the KMA consumer affairs department and reported that his engine had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V586-4168.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stalled and caught fire</a>, according to an internal incident chronology document submitted to the NHTSA. The customer also claimed to have received first-degree burns while recovering property from the burning vehicle. This individual also filed a vehicle-owner questionnaire with the NHTSA. From July 6 to July 21, the South Korean car manufacturer investigated the incident, collecting all available information in preparation for escalated internal proceedings. On July 21, KMA relayed the customer report to personnel at Kia&#8217;s facility&nbsp;in West Point, Georgia. Four days later, KMA learned of a second customer incident involving an engine fire and informed the team at&nbsp;KMGA.</p>\n<p>Between Aug. 7 and Sept. 8, KMA engineers investigated both fires and searched for a root cause. Eventually, these mechanical specialists discovered that both vehicles contained crankshafts that were not properly heat treated at the&nbsp;Hyundai Motor Company Asan Plant in South Korea.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 14, Kia Consumer Affairs reviewed all information related to the matter and chose to conduct a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>KMA will direct dealers to inspect the crankshafts and, if necessary,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V586-8736.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replace the sub-engine assemblies</a>&nbsp;in affected vehicles free of charge, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgement document. The car manufacturer plans to notify dealers Oct. 30. Owners should expect to receive notification via first-class mail Nov. 6.

The campaign affects 2017 Santa Fe sport utility vehicles with production dates ranging from Jan. 26, 2017 to Feb. 13, 2017. HMA estimates that 25 percent of the models named in the recall actually contain the defective parts.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles could contain crankshaft assemblies featuring crankshaft pins with surface irregularities. These components may lead to premature engine bearing degradation and damage. In the event that the engine bearing becomes overly worn or flawed during operation, the vehicle could stall suddenly. This increases the likelihood of an accident and consequently poses a serious risk to occupants. That said, HMA has yet to receive field reports connecting the defective crankshaft assemblies to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<p>Owners operating vehicles containing the problematic parts may hear abnormal engine noises, experience reduced motive power or see the check-engine or oil-pressure warning lamps illuminate.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On May 2, 2017, HMA received a field report that described a situation in which a customer heard a knocking sound while operating his Santa Fe. HMA personnel recovered the engine from the SUV for further evaluation soon after. Engineers at the&nbsp;Hyundai North American Quality Center in Chino, California launched an investigation into the component. Meanwhile, HMA kept an eye on the market over the course of June, July and August in an effort to pinpoint additional occurrences of knocking. The Korean automaker gathered three field reports mentioning abnormal engine noise over this span, all of which involved Santa Fe models. Additionally, one of these reports outline an instance of sudden engine failure. On Aug. 7, HMA started recovering the engines from the vehicles in these reports.</p>\n<p>Later that month, HMA engineers reviewed these parts, in addition to the engine from the original report. They found that all four engines showed signs of bearing seizure, a condition linked to&nbsp;crankshaft pins with significant surface irregularities. The car company discovered that these components were the result of ineffective production processes. Specifically, staff at the&nbsp;Hyundai Motor Company Asan&nbsp;Plant in Korea had failed to fabricate the crankshaft assemblies using proper heat treatment, a result of skewed heating coils. The facility amended its processes and corrected the problem during a tool maintenance session in January 2017.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 13, the HMA Technical Committee met to analyze the results of the investigation into the crankshaft pins and determined that the potential operating outcomes, most notably sudden engine stalling, posed a serious threat to occupants. The group then ultimately decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<p>HMA notified dealers Sept. 27.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The car company has directed dealers to inspect and, if necessary,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V578-7005.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replace the engines</a>&nbsp;in affected vehicles free of charge, according to the NHTSA. HMA plans to notify owners via first-class mail Oct. 18. Owners in need of more immediate assistance can reach out to Hyundai customer service personnel at (855) 371-9460.

The campaign affects 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport sport utility vehicles with production dates ranging from Aug. 25, 2017 to Sept. 6, 2017. The Korean automaker is unsure exactly how many of the models referenced in the recall actually come equipped with the defective features.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles may include front coil springs prone to fracture under heavy loads. In some instances, these features can extrude from the chassis and come into contact with &#8211; and puncture &#8211; vehicle tires. This increases the likelihood of an accident and therefore poses a serious threat to occupants. However, HMA has not received any reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<p>Drivers who experience coil spring fracture normally see a notable change in ride height and hear the abnormal noise created when the spring rubs against the inboard tire sidewall.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In early September 2017, Hyundai engineers conducting routine test drives at the Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama facility in Montgomery operated two vehicles that suffered coil spring fractures mid-drive. Quality assurance staff at the plant notified HMA officials via a&nbsp;Sept. 5&nbsp;internal report. Upon receiving this documentation, the automaker reviewed records to search for customer complaints referencing the problem &#8211; none were found. However, HMA did pinpoint approximately 1,700 vehicles originating from the assembly plant in Montgomery that could include the defective coil springs.</p>\n<p>The automaker determined that approximately 196 of these models had been shipped to dealers. It also learned, via an internal investigation, that the defective coils installed in these SUVs were the result of ineffective production processes involving malfunctioning coil spring forming equipment.</p>\n<p>The Mando Corporation, based in Opelika, Alabama, oversaw the operation that produced the defective parts. The parts provider repaired its coil-forming tool to prevent the production of additional defective features. It launched the overhauled equipment since Sept. 6.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 13, the HMA&nbsp;Technical Committee convened to review all information collected on the fracture-prone coil springs and eventually decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall. The automaker notified dealers and owners Sept. 27.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>HMA has directed dealers to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V577-5821.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replace the coil springs</a>&nbsp;in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgment document from the NHTSA.

Robert Bosch personnel received the part in April and immediately launched a root cause investigation. Over the course of this inquiry, the parts provider learned that the pins within the power steering control module had been improperly welded during production. Robert Bosch initiated a weld-position-monitoring program to prevent further replication of the defective features on the shop floor in May 2017. The company also reviewed its production records and discovered that 13 steering assemblies had departed its production facility with improperly affixed control module pins, all of which had been earmarked for DAG vehicles.&nbsp;As of June 1, all steering assemblies produced by&nbsp;Robert Bosch have passed quality assurance tests.</p>\n<p>In August, DAG reviewed its production records to pinpoint models containing power steering control modules with defective pins.

At least 17 people have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/business/takata-airbag-honda-death.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">died as a result</a> of these features, The New York Times reported.</p>\n<p>In Oct. 2014, Mitsubishi <a href=\"https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM479507/RCLRPT-15V321-8144.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalled more than 11,000 Lancers</a> believed to be equipped with Takata air bag inflators, according to the NHTSA. The automaker then initiated a field collection effort to recover air bag parts from affected models for further evaluation. Takata engineers reviewed the air bag components recovered from the field to see if they were actually defective. The parts provider submitted the results of the tests to Mitsubishi Nov. 19, 2004. Takata personnel had analyzed 12 inflators, with only one showing signs of abnormal inflation. The two parties convened with NHTSA officials to discuss the part, which came from a vehicle used in southern Florida.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 24, Mitsubishi decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall that included models from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. The campaign also covered vehicles sold in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Saipan and American Samoa. On May 27, 2015, the automaker expanded this recall to include all 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer sedans, as well as 2006 models containing problematic Takata SPI inflators.</p>\n<p>Between May 2015 and September 2017, Mitsubishi service teams replaced the inflators in these vehicles with like-for-like temporary parts as a stopgap measure, until permanent replacements were ready. In September 2017, the automaker finished an internal evaluation of the replacement parts, ultimately finding them satisfactory. With the replacements in hand, the car manufacturer decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall to address all of the unrepaired vehicles covered in the two previous actions.</p>\n<p>Mitsubishi notified dealers Oct. 5.</p>\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n<p>The automaker has directed dealers to replace the defective Takata air bag inflators in affected vehicles <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V569-3016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free of charge</a>, according to an NHTSA recall acknowledgment document.

The campaign affects 2003-2006 Porsche Cayenne, Cayenne S, Cayenne Titanium and Cayenne Turbo sport utility vehicles with production dates ranging from Nov. 20, 2002 to Dec. 2, 2006. The German automaker estimates 100 percent of the models referenced in the recall contain the defective features.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles are likely to include fuel pump filter flanges prone to age- and oxidation-caused cracking. More specifically, the flange material used in the recalled vehicles has been shown to break down at an accelerated rate, creating tension within the fuel pump &#8211; and&nbsp;in some cases&nbsp;causing fuel seepage. This poses a serious safety hazard to operators, as escaped gasoline could come into contact with active engine components and combust. However, Porsche has not received field reports linking the defective features to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<p>Owners with vehicles experiencing filter flange-related fuel seepage have reported noticing the odor of gasoline.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In February 2017, the NHTSA sent to Porsche seven vehicle owner queries mentioning filter flange-related fuel leakage, which had been referenced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2016/RCLRPT-16V660-7390.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in an earlier recall</a>&nbsp;initiated in October 2016, involving the Volkswagen Group of America. Then, in June, Porsche launched a 90-day field trial at the behest of the NHTSA. The program aimed to determine if the four-bar fuel pumps used in several Porsche and Volkswagen models were the the issue&#8217;s root cause.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 13, the Porsche&nbsp;Product Safety group reviewed the results of field trial and determined that four-bar fuel pumps and the filter flanges used in them were problematic. The committee called for an&nbsp; immediate voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Porsche plans to direct dealers to replace the fuel flange filters in the recalled vehicles free of charge.

The campaign affects 2011-2014 Dodge Durango and&nbsp;Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles with production dates ranging from Jan. 5, 2010 to Sept. 8, 2013. FCA estimates that roughly 41 percent of the models referenced in the recall actually contain the defective parts.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles may include incorrectly installed brake booster shields that do not effectively divert water away from the critical drivetrain features they are intended to protect. This increases the likelihood of brake booster corrosion and could lead to freezing in particularly cold environments. Both of these phenomena are capable of reducing vehicle stopping power, which poses a serious risk to occupants. FCA has not received reports connecting the defective fixtures to any injuries. However, the automaker has received one report correlating the defect to an accident.</p>\n<p>Drivers encountering braking issues stemming from ineffective brake booster shields will see their dash warning lights illuminate and experience abnormal resistance when compressing the brake pedal. In some cases, the&nbsp;anti-lock brake system may activate.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Jan. 18, 2017, the FCA&nbsp;Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance group&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V572-7854.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched an internal investigation</a>&nbsp;into field reports detailing customer complaints surrounding brake booster shield assemblies installed as part of an earlier recall, according to NHTSA documents. In February, engineers began evaluating approximately 20 brake boosters returned for further inspection. Between Feb. 23 and March 14, the third-party parts supplier responsible for fabricating the fixtures performed its own tests. On March 14, the NHTSA&#8217;s Vehicle Research and Test Center performed an independent evaluation and found that the returned brake boosters passed vacuum tests but failed to do so when brake assist was activated. The agency sent the results of this trial to FCA approximately seven days later.</p>\n<p>FCA collaborated with the NHTSA and its supplier to conduct numerous other brake booster tests throughout April, May, June and early July. On July 6, NHTSA officials performed a road test with a vehicle equipped with returned brake boosters. The testers also adjusted brake leak rates to simulate different levels of corrosion. The vehicle used in the trial exceeded Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard requirements. However, during a post-run physical evaluation, the NHTSA officials noticed that brake booster water shields had been installed incorrectly. Five days later, the agency contacted FCA and requested that it examine all of the returned parts to determine the frequency of these incorrectly installed features. The NHTSA also asked the car company to conduct an accompanying field investigation.</p>\n<p>On July 18, FCA reported that 12 of the remaining returned brake boosters in its possession included incorrectly installed water shields. It also found that of the 117 vehicles used in its field study, 41 percent had these parts. On July 27, FCA conducted an additional test which involved incorrectly installing brake booster water shields on a production vehicle, spraying it with water and letting it sit in an enclosed chamber with a temperature of -20 degrees Fahrenheit for 24 hours. During a post-spray drive, the vehicle displayed reduced pedal functionality, requiring 22 to 24 pounds-per-square-foot of power to depress. This reading was well outside of the FMVSS-approved&nbsp;range of 4-16 psf.</p>\n<p>FCA reported the results of the cold-chamber test to the FCA Aug. 8 and three days later assembled an internal committee to discuss further evaluations. The automaker performed another cold-chamber trial Aug. 23 and saw results similar to those collected during the first test. It conducted another evaluation three days later and again saw similarly problematic results. The pedals in the vehicle used in the trial required 22 to 28 psf of compression power. FCA reviewed these and other test results over the course of late August and early September.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 11, the FCA&nbsp;Vehicle Regulations Committee determined that the defect posed a serious safety hazard to owners and issued a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA will direct dealers to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V572-9125.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">re-install the brake booster water shields</a>&nbsp;in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgement document.

The campaign affects 2017 Infiniti Q50&nbsp;and Q50&nbsp;Hybrid sport utility vehicles with production dates ranging from Dec. 22, 2016 to Jan. 19, 2017. The car company suspects 1 percent of the models referenced in the recall actually contain the defective feature.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The vehicles named in this campaign could include driver-side air bag assemblies with insufficiently welded initiator collars and closure plates. This could cause cracks to form during deployment and allow gas to leave the initiator housing. Consequently, air bag assemblies in the recalled vehicles may not deploy properly in the event of a crash, increasing the risk of injury for drivers. However, Nissan has yet to receive reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In April 2017, parts supplier Nihon Plast contacted Nissan regarding an instance in which an installed air bag assembly failed to deploy properly during a low-temperature test conducted at -40 degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit. The automaker investigated the test result and found that a crack in the inflator welding had inhibited air bag deployment. Nissan then requested Nihon to&nbsp;quarantine the affected parts to be used in a forthcoming root-cause investigation. In May, Nissan met with Nihon and the Daicel Corporation, which supplied parts for the air bag assembly involved in the failed test. The three parties agreed to conduct a joint investigation. This inquiry revealed that staff at Daicel had not effectively cleaned and inspected weld jigs during the air bag assembly process, resulting in misalignment of closure plates and poor welding.</p>\n<p>In June, Nissan requested Daicel to conduct internal tests in an effort to duplicate the defective parts and further understand the mechanisms of the ineffective processes that led to their creation. Daicel agreed and launched this initiative, along with a parts collection program to analyze other previously fabricated fixtures. Both of these efforts concluded in July. Nissan then met with the parts provider to review the results, which included data on inflator weld strength. One month later, the automaker confirmed the root cause of the failed air bag deployment observed during the April trial. Quality assurance personnel then reviewed internal records to identify possibly affected vehicles and launched an internal investigation to study the safety risks associated with the defective air bag assemblies.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 7, Nissan confirmed that the defective parts posed a serious threat to owners and issued a voluntary safety recall. The car company notified dealers Sept. 15.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Nissan had directed dealers to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V571-1081.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replace the driver-side air bag inflators</a>&nbsp;in the affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgment document from the NHTSA. The automaker plans to notify owners via first-class mail Oct. 30. Those in need of more immediate assistance can contact Infiniti customer service personnel at (800) 662-6200. Owners can also reach out to the NHTSA directly through the agency&#8217;s Vehicle Safety Hotline at (888) 327-4236.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=11622","createdAt":"2017-10-01T19:33:04.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-10-02T09:18:04.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T03:57:34.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T17:42:34.000Z","display_date":"October 02, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":10,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Blue-sedan-768x510.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Blue-sedan","category":{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":14,"name":"Nissan","slug":"nissan-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nissan_RM.png"}]}]
