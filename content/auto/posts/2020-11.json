As such, having a malfunctioning axis greatly increases the risk of a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Ford supplier used “non-conforming parts” to assemble the front axle and subsequently welded them incorrectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is at least the second recall that Ford issued because of axle problems for this particular model and year. In October 2019, the manufacturer asked nearly 30,000 drivers of the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-announces-the-recall-of-some-f-250-and-f-350-vehicles/\">2019 F-250s and F-350s to take their cars in for repair because the rear axles were prone to fracture</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These same trucks are also subject to a 2019 California class-action lawsuit, alleging that their <a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/media/lessin-v-ford-motor-company-et-al.pdf\">suspension and steering problem made the F-250s and F-350s prone to a “death wobble,”  or “violent shaking”</a> at higher speeds when traveling on uneven surfaces. The lawsuit was partially dismissed in early November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V576\">recall includes <strong>2019 Ford F-250 and F-350 </strong>super-duty trucks and concerns F250/350 Front Axle Assembly</a>. The part number is <strong>JC34-3002-TB/DB/EB/FB.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some signs that your car’s axle may be broken or is not welded properly:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An unusual noise when you turn or put the car into gear</li><li>Wobbling or vibration especially in the wheel area</li><li>Brake malfunction</li><li>Car fails to move</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unsafe to continue driving the car with a broken or misaligned axle and you should take the car to the shop as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCAK-20V576-4270.pdf\">the axle is not properly welded to the vehicle, it may break, causing you to lose control</a> of the car and get into an accident. If the axle breaks, you may feel the truck get pulled to the left or the right or find that steering becomes more difficult. The effects can be more pronounced if the axle failure occurs when you brake hard.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other F-350 Super Duty Trucks recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2021, Ford Motor Company <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-f-350-trucks-for-incorrect-tire-and-payload-information/\">recalled several F-350 Super Duty Trucks, due to incorrect information on labels in the vehicles</a>, which may increase the risk of a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2021, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-vehicles-for-stalling-during-driving/\">Ford announced a recall for several Ford Super Duty F-350 pickups due to the risk of the vehicles stalling while driving</a>, increasing the risk of a crash. A driveshaft that disconnects can lead to a loss of power while driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, dealers will need to inspect the front axle of the truck and confirm if the welding was performed correctly. If not, the axle assembly will be replaced. The repair is free of charge and the recall was expected to begin on October 15, 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford estimates that the repair will be completed in less than two days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 9,500 vehicles are included in this Ford truck recall.

A tube inside the fuel pump may be blocked by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_(edge)\">burrs</a> left over from the manufacturing process. This could keep fuel from getting to the engine, particularly if the gas tank is already running low.

Even if the driver safely gets to the shoulder, they are still at risk of being hit. This raises the risk of injuries or death for everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For information on what to do if your car stalls, please see <a href=\"https://motorsafety.org/fiat-chrysler-recalls-grand-cherokees-and-1500s-with-stalling-risk/\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Owners will be notified about the recall by mail starting on November 30.

Additionally, 47 of these Toyota Highlander models have been categorized as unreachable and only one has been removed from the recall. One group of these 2020 Toyota Highlander vehicles with side curtain airbag deployment problems were remedied in 2020, and three other groups were remedied during 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pleasanton, CA – October 14, 2020</em> – Toyota (NYSE: TM)<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V633\"> has recalled</a> 3,121 Highlander crossovers whose seats may block the side airbags from deploying. The recall includes <strong>2020 Toyota Highlanders and Highlander Hybrids models.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020 Highlander’s seats contain airbags that cushion the driver side and passenger side of the vehicle in the case of a crash. In order to deploy, the airbags must burst through a seam in the front seats that is designed to tear and let the airbag out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, due to a manufacturing mix-up, pieces of the left and right seat-covers may have been reversed in these vehicles. This incorrect seat trim means that the seam may not be in the correct place, which could keep the airbags from deploying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The components involved are Seat Assy, Fr LH and Seat Assy, Fr RH, which are part of the driver and passenger seat assembly, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These<a href=\"https://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/Air+Bags/Side-Impact+Air+Bags/\"> side-impact torso airbags</a> (SABs) are designed to help protect the driver and passenger from impacts on either side of the vehicle. They would come handy if, for example, you are thrown against the door of the car during a crash or t-boned by a distracted driver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they have never been required by law, the percent of car models built with side airbags has<a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811882\"> increased steadily</a> since 1996.<a href=\"https://www.toyota.com/t3Portal/document/om-s/OM0E036U/pdf/OM0E036U.pdf\"> 2020 Highlanders,</a> and many other vehicles, pair a torso bag with a “curtain” style airbag, which covers the window and protects the driver’s head. Together, they are<a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811882\"> estimated to reduce</a> side-impact crash fatalities by 31.3%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle owners will be notified about the recall on December 13.

No related accidents or injuries have been reported to the automaker or the National Highway Transit Safety Administration (NHTSA).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Risks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Equipment failures accounted for at least 20% of vehicle fires between 2009 and 2017, according to a <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fius20th.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> by the U.S. Fire Administration. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10694-019-00944-3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Researchers</a> have said that hybrid-electric vehicles are as likely to catch fire as gas-powered vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a vehicle catches fire, <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/Public-Education/Resources/Safety-tip-sheets/Car_Fire_Safety.ashx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">the driver should</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Pull over as quickly as it is safe to do so, to a safe location off the road such as the breakdown lane or rest stop.</li><li>Once stopped, TURN OFF the engine (using the key or a smart button, if available).</li><li>Get everyone out of the car. Never return to a burning car for anything.&nbsp;</li><li>Move everyone at least 100 feet from the burning car and well away from traffic. Call 911.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid car fires <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/training/coffee_break/061819.html\" target=\"_blank\">require different firefighting techniques</a> than gas-powered vehicle fires. Engaging with a burning hybrid without the right protection could lead to electric shock, exposure to toxic fumes, and lithium burns. If you experience a hybrid vehicle fire, make sure emergency services know that the vehicle is a hybrid so they can best protect you and themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to BMW, the remedy for this issue <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCMN-20V601-3473.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is still “under discussion.”</a> Customers should look for a recall notification in the mail, which will be sent out sometime in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the remedy is available, BMW is telling drivers not to charge the battery of their plug-in vehicles, drive in manual mode, sport mode or use the shift paddles. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 4,500 vehicles are included in this BMW recall.
