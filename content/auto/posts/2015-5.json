On the other hand, the six deaths associated with the exploding Takata systems were originally all traced to Honda vehicles.</p>\n<p>The new total for cars recalled because of Takata airbag concerns is now near $35 million, the source said, and Honda is taking the effort to replace faulty inflators. Earlier this week, Nissan and Toyota recalled more than 6 million vehicles total for similar worries.</p>\n<p>Sho Minekawa, the company&#8217;s CEO, said that the new recall is expected to have &#8220;some impact&#8221; on Japanese sales. Reuters said that other manufacturers from that country will likely face pressure from the transport minister to follow in Honda&#8217;s footsteps and issue their own recalls.</p>\n<p>This same week, Acura, a division of Honda, also recalled several vehicles, albeit for an unrelated issue. A statement from that company said that 19,500 MDX and RLX cars are being recalled because of a fault in the Collision Mitigation Braking System that could be triggered by &#8220;a metallic structure.&#8221; The radar system could apply the brakes at the wrong time and possibly instigate a crash.</p>\n<p>In both of these cases, circulating proper recall information is paramount to replacing defective systems and achieving goals. The Takata recall is likely to inspire more news in the future, so giving consumers and dealers the knowledge they need may help them prepare for further response efforts.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://activetechnologies.us/rm/?p=3207","createdAt":"2015-05-27T13:30:52.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-05-28T03:15:52.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T01:07:04.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T14:52:04.000Z","display_date":"May 27, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":5,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Honda-accord-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Honda-accord","category":{"id":4,"name":"Honda","slug":"honda-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":4,"name":"Honda","slug":"honda-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/honda_ms.png"}]},{"id":10775,"title":"Hybrid vehicles recalled for bad frames [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/hybrid-vehicles-recalled-bad-frames-video/","status":"publish","slug":"hybrid-vehicles-recalled-bad-frames-video","excerpt":"<p>Hundreds of hybrid cars were recalled recently.</p>\n","description":"<p>This month, hybrid vehicle owners may want to reinspect their cars if they own a GEM from Polaris Industries.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer is recalling 628 vehicles that may have been affected by a faulty frame weld.

Together, these recalls concern more than 442,000 vehicles across North America, most of which are in the United States, and so far neither of the conditions the company is addressing have resulted in any known injuries, although one has led to four &#8220;minor accidents&#8221; that could be related to one of the concerns.</p>\n<p>Those accidents are attributed to the larger of the two recalls, which includes a group of some 422,800 vehicles for the model years between 2011 and 2013. Affected models include Ford Taurus, Ford Flex, Lincoln MKZ and Mercury Milan automobiles, originating from assembly plants in Chicago, Hermosillo and Oakville. These vehicles are at risk of a electric power steering fault that could suddenly shift steering modes while the vehicle is in use.</p>\n<p>The other recall targets a much smaller group of 19,486 2015 Ford Mustangs, specifically those with 2.3 liter engines. The release says that the underbodies of these vehicles are potentially more vulnerable in higher temperatures.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Prolonged exposure to elevated underbody temperatures might cause degradation of the fuel tank and fuel vapor lines, which could eventually result in a fuel leak,&#8221; it says. &#8220;In addition, prolonged exposure to elevated underbody temperatures might cause the parking brake cable seals to degrade, potentially affecting parking brake functions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In both cases, car dealers will perform the necessary repairs, although the steering issue may require an additional new gear replacement if a simple software fix isn&#8217;t enough.

Though they apply to different faults in the affected cars, the two recalls do both concern problems that might make visibility difficult during a drive: one relates to windshield defroster blowers and the other to an electronic control unit (ECU) that may detract from windshield wipers and outer vehicle lights. The model years of all vehicles involve range from 2009 to 2011.</p>\n<p>All together, the recalls account for a combined 130,400 cars, the majority of which are subject to the blower recall. This includes Lancer, Lancer Sportback, Lancer Evolution Outlander and Outlander Sport vehicles.

If the tail lights fail, the vehicle could be less visible.

Although the report says this happens &#8220;in rare circumstances,&#8221; it also notes that this is still in violation of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 102. The condition is believed to be caused by a flash memory corruption in the PRNDM display.</p>\n<p>The actions dates back to tests on these vehicles conducted in 2012, and includes a petition action from General Motors in that year: the company argued that its noncompliance related to an &#8220;inconsequential&#8221; element of the cars, and later revised its original report.</p>\n<p>This document also features a description of exactly <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM477478/RCLRPT-15V245-7113.PDF\">why the panel display error could be considered dangerous</a> to drivers.

I think it is incredible that I did my part, took the car to get the recall fixed and was returned a car that was clearly not fixed.&#8221; The source adds that there have been no official reports of injury, and that Fiat Chrysler is working with the NHTSA in response to the query.</p>\n<p>In addition to the original recalls, recall queries and other follow-up actions also have to be communicated to the right dealerships and owners, to ensure that the latest, most relevant actions are taken to fix a possible risk.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://activetechnologies.us/rm/?p=3188","createdAt":"2015-05-06T08:57:45.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-05-06T22:42:45.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T00:14:30.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T13:59:30.000Z","display_date":"May 06, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":5,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dodge-Durango-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Dodge-Durango","category":{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":7,"name":"Dodge","slug":"dodge-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dodge.png"},{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"}]},{"id":3186,"title":"More cars added to Ford latch recall numbers","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/more-cars-added-to-ford-latch-recall-numbers/","status":"publish","slug":"more-cars-added-to-ford-latch-recall-numbers","excerpt":"<p>Detroit, MI — May 4, 2015 — Previously, Ford announced a recall of 389,585 cars for a problem related to faulty door latches.

In affected vehicles, which include Ford Fiestas and Lincoln MKZ&#8217;s, broken pawl spring tabs could lead to doors opening up unexpectedly, posing a hazard to driver.

The Detroit Free Press says that door latch concerns have been responsible for five recall actions since 2014: while this latest one has brought the total amount up to more than 545,900, the amount of cars recalled for latch problems since 2014 is higher than 1.5 million.</p>\n<p>As with the original action, this further recall also encompasses Ford Fiestas, Ford Fusions and Lincoln MKZ&#8217;s across North America.

According to the official notice on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, 2,580 units are potentially affected by this recall, which will officially begin June 5. The Accents that are subject to the recall were produced between September 15, 2014, and February 10 of this year.</p>\n<p>Normally, the ODS is supposed to detect if a child is in the front passenger seat of a vehicle and prevent an airbag from inflating during an accident, which would endanger the child. In the vehicles addressed by the recall, the source notes that <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM477759/RCAK-15V218-3495.pdf\">the opposite is true</a>, and that the system could be affected by cold temperatures, interfering with the sensor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the ODS fails to detect that the seat is occupied by a child restraint seat, the front air bag will not be deactivated and, in the event of a crash necessitating front air bag deployment, there would be an increased risk of injury to the occupant in the child restraint seat,&#8221; the statement reads.</p>\n<p>To remedy this, Accent owners should bring their autos to dealers, who will fix the problem in the ODS software. Consumer Affairs quoted a spokesman from the company, who gave more details about the kinds of temperatures that will activate the problem: as he said, the fault is only likely to persist as long as the interior of the car is &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/hyundai-recalls-accent-vehicles-050115.html\">below 0 degrees Fahrenheit</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sending out a tailored recall notice system can help businesses mention certain details, like the temperature in this example, which influence a defect or might make it stand out more.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://activetechnologies.us/rm/?p=3184","createdAt":"2015-05-03T08:12:42.000Z","date_gmt":"2015-05-03T21:57:42.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-19T01:43:44.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-19T15:28:44.000Z","display_date":"May 03, 2015","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":10,"name":"Recall Masters","slug":"recallmasters_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2015,"month":5,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Red-Hyundai-Solaris-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Red-Hyundai-Solaris","category":{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"}]}]
