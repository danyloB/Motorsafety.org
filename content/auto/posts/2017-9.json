The campaign affects 2017-2018 Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicles with production dates ranging from Feb. 27, 2017 to Aug. 10, 2017. The car company suspects that 100 percent of the vehicles referenced in the recall contain the defective labels.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles likely have tire and rim labels that fail to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 110, which stipulates that all road-worthy models <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7d443eb75ceba033fed91e90f816b574&amp;node=se49.6.571_1110&amp;rgn=div8\">include labeling</a> showing the &#8220;size designation and, if applicable, the type designation of rims (not necessarily those on the vehicle) appropriate for the tire appropriate for use on that vehicle, including the tire installed as original equipment on the vehicle by the vehicle manufacturer,&#8221; according to the Government Publishing Office. The vehicles named in the recall feature wheels and tires that do not contain the proper information, which may lead to the installation of noncompliant&nbsp;tires or wheels, and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;increase the likelihood of an accident.</p>\n<p>However, FCA has yet to receive field reports linking the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Aug. 10, 2017, the FCA Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance group received an internal report from the Information and Communication Technology division indicating that some 2017-2018 Jeep Cherokee vehicles originating from the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Belvidere, Illinois had rolled off the line with tire and wheel labels meant for passenger cars, rather than multipurpose models. Officials from the FCA VSRC group immediately reached out to the Quality Center Manager at the BVAP facility, who confirmed the existence of the issue and attributed it to a printing error. QA personnel at the plant instituted a yard hold to prevent noncompliant vehicles from departing.</p>\n<p>On Aug. 24, after reviewing production logs for the BVAP plant and confirming non-compliance with FMVSS 110, the FCA Vehicle Regulations Committee called for a voluntary safety recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>FCA will direct dealers to replace the certification labels in affected vehicles free of charge. The car manufacturer plans to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V543-4326.pdf\">notify both dealers</a>&nbsp;Oct. 20, according to documents filed with the NHTSA. The company will notify owners via first-class mail on or about that same day. Those in need of more immediate assistance leading up to the official recall date can contact Chrysler customer service personnel at (800) 853-1403. Callers should use the internal recall identification code T53.

The campaign affects 2015-2016 Mazda6 sedans produced between Nov. 3, 2014 and Dec. 9, 2015. Mazda is uncertain how many of the vehicles actually include the defective features.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected models are likely to contain front passenger seat frames with high levels of weld spatter. When passengers are present, this excess metal could make contact with the classification wire harnesses installed beneath the seat frames and abrade them over time, leading to short circuiting and the eventual loss of power steering assist and air bags. In the event that power steering assist is lost, multiple warning lights illuminate. Drivers will still be able to maneuver their vehicles to evade other drivers. However, when weld splatter abrades wire harnesses and air bag functionality is inhibited, these safety features will not work should an accident unfold.</p>\n<p>That said, Mazda has not received reports connecting the defect to any injuries or accidents.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Dec. 1, 2015, Mazda received a field report from the U.S. market outlining an instance in which all of the dashboard lights illuminated in a Mazda6 sedan. Engineering personnel investigated the report and found that the occupant sensor wiring harness in the car was abraded due to extensive weld spatter on the front passenger seat frame. Approximately eight days later, the Japanese automaker rolled out amended assembly processes that involved installing protective pads beneath the seat frames in Mazda6 models. On February 5, 2016, quality assurance personnel reviewed all information related to the defect and resulting production fix, and determined that a voluntary recall was unnecessary as there was a low frequency of occurrence and drivers could still safely maintain control of their vehicles in the event of complete wire harness abrasion. Mazda continued to monitor the field for more reports.</p>\n<p>By Nov. 29, 2016, 13 more field reports materialized, forcing the automaker to reassess its earlier decision. However, by March 3, 2017, few other occurrences cropped up. On July 25, Mazda shared information on the defect and the assembly amendment with the NHTSA during a technical presentation. The agency requested more detailed data, which the automaker submitted to NHTSA officials Aug. 10 during a follow-up meeting. The NHTSA offered additional guidance on the matter Aug. 21. Mazda convened a&nbsp;Quality Audit Committee meeting Aug. 24 and decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall based on this discussion.</p>\n<p>The car manufacturer notified dealers Sept. 22.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Mazda directed dealers to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V546-9225.pdf\">attach protective pads</a>&nbsp;to front passenger seat frames installed in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgment document. Service crews are also supposed to inspect wire harnesses and apply insulating tape if they show signs of abrasion. The car company plans to notify owners via first-class mail Sept. 29. Those in need of more immediate assistance can reach out to Mazda customer service at (800) 222-5500. Callers should use the internal recall identification code 1517H.

From July 20 to Aug. 4, personnel from the automaker&#8217;s&nbsp;Supplier Quality Engineering group reached out to parts providers and worked with these firms to identify the structural issues that might have caused the instance of disengagement. On Aug. 4, the SQE group confirmed that&nbsp;GKN Driveline North America, based in Mexico, had shipped a total of eight driveshafts with incorrect lengths, five of which were installed in production vehicles. Four days later, the FCA&nbsp;VSRC&nbsp;department opened an investigation into the SQE group&#8217;s findings.

Hyundai suspects just 2 percent of the vehicles named in the recall contain the defective fixtures.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Hyundai Ioniq sedans are equipped with aluminum-encased EPCU devices that transform alternating current power into direct current power for charging the battery system. The vehicles named in the campaign could contain EPCU devices whose aluminum shells feature small voids that allow coolant to leak onto EPCU circuit boards, leading to stalling. These cracked casings increase the likelihood of an accident &#8211; especially at high speeds &#8211; and therefore poses a serious danger to occupants. However, Hyundai has not received reports connecting the problematic EPCU coverings to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In June 2017, the South Korean automaker received a field report outlining an instance in which an Ioniq owner was forced to tow his vehicle to a dealer after it stalled on the road. In this instance, the &#8220;check electrical vehicle system&#8221; light illuminated. Hyundai received another field report later in the month describing a similar situation.</p>\n<p>In July, the car company collected parts from both vehicles and delivered them to engineering staff for evaluation. Personnel immediately spotted the cracked EPCU casings and diagnosed the root cause of both breakdowns. Hyundai then contacted the Korea-based parts provider responsible for delivering the defective aluminum fixtures. The company, Hyundai Mobis, traced the defective EPCU coverings to a manufacturing process revision made in April 2017. Hyundai quality assurance personnel reviewed all the available information related to the cracked EPCU housings and decided conduct a voluntary safety recall Aug. 17.</p>\n<p>The car company notified owners of the action Sept. 1.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Hyundai has directed dealers to inspect and <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V532-2404.pdf\">replace the EPCU units</a> in affected vehicles free of charge, according to a recall acknowledgement document from the NHTSA.

The campaign affects 2017 Explorer sport utility vehicles and Taurus sedans, as well as Police Interceptor sedans and utility vehicles. Ford estimates that 80 percent of the vehicles referenced in the recall contain the defective features.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Affected vehicles likely&nbsp;contain steering-gear heat fasteners that have not been properly coated with a corrosion-resistant finish. As a result, moisture may corrode these and other nearby metal fixtures, possibly leading the heat shield to detach completely from the steering gear. This may expose the steering gear assembly to higher than expected temperatures, which triggers thermal protection mode. In this scenario, steering assist functionality decreases while the gears cool. While not overtly dangerous, this situation could affect vehicle maneuverability and increase the likelihood of an accident. However, Ford has not received any field reports connecting the defective heat fasteners to any injuries of accidents.</p>\n<p>Drivers operating vehicles with defective heat gear fasteners that have caused steering-gear overheating and activated thermal protection mode will hear audible chimes and see an engine warning on the dash cluster.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In May 2017, a worker at the ITW Shakeproof Group, Ford&#8217;s steering-gear module supplier, noticed that the gear heat fasteners on one assembly approved for shipment happened to be black in color. The employee reported the issue to his superiors who notified Ford. The automaker&#8217;s plant on Chicago, which was responsible for producing the vehicles equipped with steering gear modules from the Shakeproof Group, stopped shipments immediately. Engineers at the facility then launched an investigation.</p>\n<p>Ford determined that the supplier had sent over steering-gear modules with the wrong fasteners, which were not properly coated to protect against corrosion. The car manufacturer brought this evidence in front of the&nbsp;Critical Concern Review Group on May 23.</p>\n<p>Over the course of June and July, personnel from the engineering department analyzed the black fasteners to see if they succeeded in retaining vehicle heat shields. Ford also began reviewing plant assembly and shipment records to determine if vehicles had left the facility with the steering gear modules featuring these fixtures installed.</p>\n<p>In August, the Ford Field Review Committee examined both reports from the engineering team, as well as the production and shipment logs for the Chicago assembly site. On Aug. 21, the group concluded that a voluntary safety recall was necessary. The automaker informed dealers of the recall action Aug. 29.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford has directed dealers to replace black steering-gear heat fasteners in affected models with properly coated models, free of charge. The car company began notifying owners via first-class mail Sept. 11.

This could inhibit ELR functionality and put occupants at risk during traffic accidents. However, BMW has yet to receive field reports connecting the defect to any accidents or injuries.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Engineers at an unspecified BMW assembly facility discovered the defect seat belt assemblies during a post-production test drive on July 17, 2017. These fixtures failed to perform up to standard during braking and cornering tests. BMW personnel examined the seat belts in the vehicle subjected to road testing and determined that its ELRs&nbsp;did not activate properly. The car company then shipped the defective features to the German ELR provider ZF TRW Automotive for internal analysis. Quality assurance staff at the parts manufacturer determined that the ELRs were the product of ineffective production processes. Specifically, assemblers had equipped with parts with incompatible vehicle-sensitive mechanism housings, which inhibited the operation of this feature.</p>\n<p>After receiving these results, BMW conducted multiple investigations to determine how many vehicles had been fitted with the defective parts. With the information in hand, the vehicle manufacturer launched a voluntary safety recall on Aug. 7, 2017. BMW contacted owners nine days later.</p>\n<p>On Aug. 25, BMW <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V507-6939.pdf\">announced a delivery delay</a> for approximately 1200 4 Series convertibles believed to include the problematic seat belt assembly, according to internal documentation submitted to the NHTSA.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>BMW has requested that dealers inspect the seat belt assemblies on affected vehicles and replace them if necessary, with no charge to the customer. The company is <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V507-1758.pdf\">expected to notify owners</a> Oct. 9, according to the NHTSA.

These documents described instances in which vehicles would stall when accelerating out of complete stops or slow rolls. Over the course of April and May 2017, the car company received multiple claims from owners. Claim volumes further increased during the summer months, the majority of which seemed to come from owners living in regions with high temperatures. Audi initiated an internal investigation in response to these filings, and discovered that virtually all of the claims originated from owners in cities with warm climates. It also found that the stalling behavior was a result of problematic ECU software.</p>\n<p>On Aug. 9, quality assurance personnel at automaker decided to conduct a voluntary safety recall.
