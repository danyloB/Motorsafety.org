Additionally, 462 of these models have been categorized as unreachable and 134 have been removed from the recall. Two groups of Ram pickup truck models were remedied in 2020 and three were remedied in 2021 for bed steps that may cause failures when used with heavy loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a minor, non-mechanical problem compared to other <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/ram-trucks-under-investigation-for-stalling-issues/\">stalling issues experienced by the Chrysler RAM 2500 and RAM 3500 pickup trucks</a>, these truck owners should remove the platform step because it can fail unexpectedly during use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laguna Hills, CA – May 15, 2020 – Chrysler recalled a total of 37,580 2019 and 2020 Ram 2500 pickup trucks and <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V207-3972.PDF\">Ram 3500 pickup trucks that have had issues with the bed step accessory</a>. During heavy loading, the bed step can break leading to user injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Dangers of a Faulty Bed Step</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a bed step is a convenient feature that makes it easier for the user to climb into the bed of the truck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ram trucks, if too much pressure is applied to the bed step, such as when a user steps up while carrying a heavy item, it can cause the support brace holding the step in place to break. As of March 30, 2020, owners have filed a total of 27 warranty claims. While there are no reported injuries from the faulty steps, the risk of an eventual fall and injury is imminent without the recall in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the National Safety Council (NSC), over nine million﻿ <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/work-safety/safety-topics/slips-trips-falls\">people went to the emergency room for treatment of an injury related to a fall</a> in 2016. While the <a href=\"https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/deaths-by-demographics/top-10-preventable-injuries/\">NSC considers a fall to be a preventable injury</a>, it is largely unavoidable when it comes to faulty equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is Your Vehicle Affected?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the production records, the recall consists of 25,822 Ram 2500 pickups. The manufacture dates of all the pickup trucks are between October 18, 2018, and March 1, 2020. The recall also includes 11,758 Ram 3500 pickup trucks manufactured between January 8, 2019, and March 1, 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Replacement Bed Steps Are Currently Unavailable</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, no repair for the bed step assembly is available. A letter sent to dealers by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instructs them to remove the bed step assembly on all unsold vehicles. Chrysler will notify dealers when a new deployable bed step becomes available. At that time, the dealers will be able to contact the vehicle owners to bring their trucks in for the installation of a new bed step at no cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>RAM 2500 safety issues</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The owners of the Ram recall should be also aware of two previous Ram recalls. In March 2020, Chrysler recalled over 87,000 trucks because of a <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-leaking-transmission-fluid-poses-fire-risk-in-recalled-ram-trucks/\">potential fire hazard caused by leaking transmission fluid on these RAM pickups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same trucks are also among 318,537 recalled vehicles because of a rear-view camera display image that remains on longer than ten seconds. The<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalls-jeep-ram-dodge-vehicles-to-fix-distracting-rear-view-camera/\"> lingering display image﻿ in several models of Jeep SUVs could distract the driver</a> and possibly contribute to a vehicular accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scheduling a Repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To locate a dealership near you to remove the bed step and avoid the danger of this faulty equipment, visit Motorsafety.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 27,000 vehicles are included in this Chrysler recall.

The manufacturer will cover the cost to repair vehicles, which consists of a software update that could take up to a half day to repair at a certified service center. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Driving Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear-view camera potentially leads to a crash because once the driver shifts into drive, the vehicle is in forward motion while the navigation system displays an image in backward motion. If this were to happen while the driver pulls into traffic or an area with pedestrians, the risks of a crash increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"mce_39\"><strong>The Threat Of Distracted Driving</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">According to the CDC</a>, distracted drivers pose a serious problem that results in thousands of deaths each year.

The fix is fast, simple, and free, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V208000&amp;refurl=rss\" target=\"_blank\">NHTSA recall information</a> says.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Jeep Compass SUVs manufactured from May 12, 2019, through March 3, 2020.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Ram 1500 and Ram 1500 Classic pickups built from April 28, 2019, through March 3, 2020.</strong><br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A nut that does not fit properly might cause wiper blades to loosen and not work properly, which could impair driver vision. 425,588 vehicles recalled, including 316,626 Ram 1500 pickups and 108,962 Jeep Compass SUVs. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how well you plan ahead, something incredibly simple can trigger big problems.

If you drive a Jeep Compass SUV, Ram 1500, or Ram 1500 Classic that was built in the past two years, Fiat Chrysler recalls say you might have a pending problem with your windshield wiper blades. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/ram-trucks-jeep-suvs-recalled-faulty-windshield-wipers/\" target=\"_blank\">No accidents or injuries</a> are know to exist due to the problem, Fiat-Chrysler says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Loose Wiper Blades Are a Problem</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a wiper blade becomes loose, it does not provide the proper tension to work properly. Instead of cleanly wiping the windshield clean and providing clear vision, the wiper blades just smear fluid on the windshield and obscures vision. The lights of an oncoming vehicle could blind a driver, too. Jeep Compass recalls cite the same problem affecting Jeep Compass SUVs built in 2019 and 2020 that Ram cites for its pickups built during the same timeframe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Incredibly Fast and Simple Fix</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the world of vehicle safety recalls, the fix could not be quicker or simpler. The solution is to tighten the nut just a quarter of a turn. That means you can get your wiper blades fixed quickly and ensure clear vision on rainy or snowy drives. They might even install new wiper blades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recent Jeep SUV, Ram Truck Recalls for Fire Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeep currently is <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/pressure-plate-on-clutch-may-overheat-increase-risk-of-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">recalling more than 33,000 Wranglers and Gladiators</a> with manual transmissions due to a fire risk. The Jeeps built in 2018 through 2020 have clutch plates that might fail and leak fluid that might cause a fire.

The recall says the trucks have faulty fuel lines that might develop cracks and leak fuel. The leaking fuel might catch fire if it comes into contact with the exhaust manifold.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Search Recent Ram 1500 and Jeep Recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn more about recalls for Jeep and Ram trucks at motorsafety.org and use the free vehicle recall search tool that lets you input your VIN and find out if any recalls affect your vehicle.
