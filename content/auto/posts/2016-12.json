Tires of size 275/40R19 101W that were manufactured between Feb. 29, 2016 and Oct. 29, 2016 have faulty carcass components, which may cause cracks to develop in the lower sidewalls as the tires reach the end of their tread lives. This leads to air loss, which could then make the affected vehicles harder to control. Pirelli believes that nearly 3,400 tires suffer from this defect.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>Oct. 27, 2016 &#8211; During a routine test, one Pirelli tire did not meet internal specifications. Additional examination found that it contained incorrectly sized components, which led the manufacturer to conduct a check of all the others being produced that week. Inspectors were then able to determine the production range that had been affected by the defect.</p>\n<p>Nov. 8, 2016 &#8211; All tires were subjected to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and passed. However, Pirelli decided to conduct a recall anyway, due to the possibility that tires in the field could have more significant problems.</p>\n<h2>Resolution</h2>\n<p>Pirelli will work with Maserati to have new tires installed on all vehicles currently being held in dealer inventory.

Fortunately, there have been no reported deaths or injuries from the defect.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=8915","createdAt":"2016-12-06T01:38:55.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-12-06T15:23:55.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-29T11:36:37.000Z","modified_gmt":"2018-03-30T01:21:37.000Z","display_date":"December 06, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":null,"nhtsa_campaign_number":null,"recall_date":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null,"custom_schema":null},"year":2016,"month":12,"alt_text":"","cld_public_id":null,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Chevrolet","slug":"chevrolet-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chevy_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":12,"name":"Chevrolet","slug":"chevrolet-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chevy_ms.png"}]},{"id":8935,"title":"Toyota Recalls Minivans For Sliding Door Malfunction","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/toyota-recalls-minivans-sliding-door-malfunction/","status":"publish","slug":"toyota-recalls-minivans-sliding-door-malfunction","excerpt":"<p>Toyota Sienna minivans have an issue that may cause automatic sliding doors to open while driving.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Nov. 22 &#8211; Torrance, California&nbsp;&#8211;</em> Toyota recently announced a recall of Sienna minivans&nbsp;in response to electrical problems that may affect the operation of power sliding doors.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Defect</strong></h3>\n<p>According to documents compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the problem appears to have <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM546851/RMISC-16V858-6717.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">affected Sienna vehicles</a> from the 2011-2016 model years &#8211; specifically, those manufactured between Jan. 4, 2010 and Aug. 12, 2016. The issue can arise when something impedes the normal operation of the power sliding doors, such as ice in the winter. When this happens, the motor stalls, generating current and operating the fuse for the door motor. There is a chance that this can cause the door to open unexpectedly while the vehicle is moving.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline</strong></h3>\n<p>January&nbsp;2014 &nbsp;&#8211; April 2015 &#8211; Toyota first received reports of a malfunctioning door from a dealer. While an initial inspection found that the door cable was not attached to the latch mechanism, the parts still functioned normally when reattached and no abnormalities in the cable installment process were found. At the time, Toyota concluded that this was an isolated incident.</p>\n<p>November&nbsp;2015 &#8211; April 2016 &#8211; Toyota received more reports of similar issues. In some vehicles, the sliding doors refused to latch. Two reports indicated that doors opened while the vehicles were moving. Further investigation determined that these problems tended to emanate from cold climates.</p>\n<p>May 2016 &#8211; November&nbsp;2016 &#8211; Toyota determined that freezing could cause the sliding door motor to stall, leading to further malfunctions down the road. The company then announced its voluntary safety recall campaign.</p>\n<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>\n<p>Toyota will mail notices to affected vehicle owners by Jan. 21, 2017. This letter will include instructions for those owners who have already paid for repairs and wish to apply for reimbursement from the automaker.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=8935","createdAt":"2016-12-05T03:55:05.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-12-05T17:40:05.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T01:36:31.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-03T15:21:31.000Z","display_date":"December 05, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2016,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shutterstock_1742437895-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_1742437895-1","category":{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"}]},{"id":4013,"title":"Ford recalls 680,000 cars; seat belts may not hold in crash [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalls-680000-cars-seat-belts-may-not-hold-crash-video/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-recalls-680000-cars-seat-belts-may-not-hold-crash-video","excerpt":"<p>December 2, 2016 report from Q13 Fox News</p>\n","description":"<h5 class=\"yt watch-title-container\">December 2, 2016 report from <span style=\"color: #118acb;\"><em><a style=\"color: #118acb;\" href=\"http://q13fox.com/2016/12/02/ford-recalls-680000-cars-seat-belts-may-not-hold-in-crash/\" target=\"_blank\">Q13 Fox News</a></em></span></h5>\n<p><script height=\"440px\" width=\"360px\" src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=c8cff4cec9d94ae0896f6443af7ee837&#038;ec=ZybDYwODE6o3-MD8lgFzh_OIl8wH8hCa\"></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"http://www.motorsafety.org/?p=3384","createdAt":"2016-12-02T17:09:46.000Z","date_gmt":"2016-12-03T06:54:46.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-04-02T06:13:18.000Z","modified_gmt":"2018-04-02T19:58:18.000Z","display_date":"December 02, 2016","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":5,"name":"Sean Reyes","slug":"sreyes"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":null,"nhtsa_campaign_number":null,"recall_date":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null,"custom_schema":null},"year":2016,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ford_ms-1.png","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"ford_ms-1","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":8922,"title":"Daimler Vans Recalls Vehicles For Faulty Brake Lights","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/daimler-vans-recalls-vehicles-faulty-brake-lights/","status":"publish","slug":"daimler-vans-recalls-vehicles-faulty-brake-lights","excerpt":"<p>Daimler Vans USA has announced a recall of Dodge and Freightliner Sprinter 2500 and 3500 vans.</p>\n","description":"<p><em>Atlanta &#8211; Nov. 11, 2016 &#8211;</em> Daimler Vans USA has announced a recall of Dodge and Freightliner Sprinter 2500 and 3500 vans due to problems with brake warning light illumination.<br />\n<span id=\"pk-id\"></span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Defect</strong></h3>\n<p>According to documents compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Daimler <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM546230/RCLRPT-16V833-5654.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">will recall vans</a> from the 2003-2006 model years &#8211; specifically, those manufactured between June 30, 2003 and Aug.&nbsp;31, 2006. The problem is that the brake warning lamps located on the vehicles&#8217; instrument clusters are failing to illuminate during startup.</p>\n<p>This initial illumination is a good way to let the driver know that the light is functioning as intended. After that point, as long as the light remains off, drivers can be reasonably confident that they do not have any serious brake issues to address. The purpose of the lamp is to warn occupants of low brake fluid, which could severely impact their ability to stop on command.</p>\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Events</strong></h3>\n<p>April 2015 &#8211; Fiat Chrysler reportedly asked Daimler Vans for support with Dodge vehicles that failed the bulb check during New York State inspections. Daimler Vans examined numerous vehicle models from different years, as well as different instrument clusters, to locate the problems. This was a challenging process that required the manufacturer to study instrument cluster coding and analyze each system to determine the underlying cause. At first, Daimler Vans did not have access to all of the information necessary, forcing it to use other methods to replicate the problem.</p>\n<p>October 2016 &#8211; Daimler Vans received more information about the faulty bulb, including the proper instrument coding. This allowed the manufacturers to determine exactly which vehicles were being affected.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>\n<p>Daimler Vans will conduct a voluntary recall to examine each vehicle&#8217;s instrument cluster coding and fix any problems that can be found. This will be done free of charge.
