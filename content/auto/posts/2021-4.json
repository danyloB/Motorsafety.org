The investigation cites 15 complaints and covers the following vehicles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Cadillac CT4</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Cadillac CT5</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Cadillac Escalade</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Cadillac Escalade ESV</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Cadillac XT5</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 2500</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 3500</strong></li><li><strong>2020-2021 Chevrolet Suburban</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 GMC Sierra 1500</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 GMC Sierra 2500</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 GMC Sierra 3500</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 GMC Yukon</strong></li><li><strong>2020 &#8211; 2021 GMC Yukon XL</strong></li><li><strong>2020 GMC Sierra Denali</strong></li><li><strong>2021 Chevrolet Suburban 1500</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Chevrolet Silverado 4500HD</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Chevrolet Silverado 5500HD</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Chevrolet Silverado 6500HD</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Complaints&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the 15 complaints, consumers submitted to the regulator, the <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/takata-recall-spotlight\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA), six mention serious crashes where the airbags failed to deploy, while eight highlight injuries that occurred in connection with the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One complaint from Dayton, Ohio graphically describes the consequences when one driver’s airbag failed to deploy in an accident, resulting in a serious head injury. During the accident, “something hit [the driver&#8217;s] face while the &#8220;steering wheel airbag&#8221; failed to deploy. The driver remembers crawling out of their overturned Cadillac Escalade and being taken to the hospital. Upon being discharged, the person experienced “loss of taste and smell” except for the “smell of brain matter” from “fluid” dripping down their nasal cavity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other complaints describe the airbags failing to deploy despite the driver hitting several trees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cause of the problem</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The administration’s investigation points to a bulletin GM posted for dealers and repair shops in March, addressing problems with the airbag warning light. The bulletin blames the problem on “rust particles in the connection terminal interface of the driver airbag inflator.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, according to a statement obtained by the Associated Press (AP), GM said it was unaware of any airbags failing to deploy due to this problem, adding that its own analysis of the issue found that airbags would still deploy in a crash even if the malfunction light was on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the complaints describe the airbag and “service safety restraint system” warning lights coming on as often as “every two to three minutes when driving.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other GM airbag recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GM has recently<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-ordered-to-recall-5-9-million-cars-equipped-with-takata-airbags/\"> recalled close to 6 million cars because of potentially lethal Takata airbags that may rupture when deployed</a>.

The connection between the two may be slightly loose and allow for increased “play” between the two parts over time. Initially, the issue could cause noises when steering or steering that is less “precise” than usual. If left unrepaired, the steering shaft could separate from the joint entirely, causing the driver to lose the ability to steer the car.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of break is most likely to occur at lower speeds, such as while parking, as this is when the greatest force is required to steer the car. Even at low speeds, however, loss of steering ability is unsafe and increases the risk of a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far there has been only one known instance of the shaft separating from the joint. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V229-3239.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">It did not cause any crashes or injuries</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercedes-Benz dealers will check the car’s steering shaft and replace it, if necessary.

Owners who already paid to have their roof panels re-attached may be eligible for reimbursement. More information about when and how to seek repairs will be sent out to owners in the week of May 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 15,000 vehicles are included in this Mercedes Benz recall.

The recall includes the following convertibles, sedans and crossover SUVs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2020 Audi A3 </strong></li><li><strong>2016 &#8211; 2018 Audi A3 e-tron</strong></li><li><strong>2017 &#8211; 2020 Audi RS3 </strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2019 Audi A3 Cabriolet</strong></li><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2020 Audi S3 </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The component in question is the “repair kit for passenger seat occupant detection,” part number 8V0898522.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall addresses an ongoing problem with the Passenger Occupant Detection System (PODS), which senses when there is a passenger sitting in the front seat. The PODS is supposed to deactivate the passenger airbag when the seat is empty, but in the case of recalled cars, the airbag “turns off” even when the seat is occupied, increasing the risk of an injury to the passenger in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V198-1520.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The deactivation may occur sporadically and “for a limited amount of time</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Previous recall</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A previous recall for this issue was conducted in 2019 but failed to fix the issue as the manufacturer kept receiving reports that some repaired PODS have continued to malfunction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent customer complaints about this issue highlighted that this was a “<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2015/AUDI/A3/4%252520DR/AWD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">known problem” for “many Audi models, not just A3 and S3</a>” and that, in addition to the airbag issue, some of these models also experienced a seat belt malfunction. The seat belt warning kept going off even though there was no one in the seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data shows that <a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/808470\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">airbags reduce crash fatalities by 11%</a>, but they can only protect people if they actually deploy. Deactivated airbags cannot protect passengers in a crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle occupants need to pay attention to the airbag indicator light, which will illuminate if the airbag system has been deactivated. Along with the light, the occupants should also hear a chime and see an error message in the instrument panel. If the warnings come on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have the front passenger sit elsewhere in the car.</li><li>Do NOT use the front passenger seat going forward.</li><li>Take the car to the nearest dealership as soon as possible.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Audi is still investigating the problem and has not determined what the repair will be.&nbsp; Owners will receive letters in the mail with more information about the recall on May 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 153,000 vehicles are included in this Audi recall.
