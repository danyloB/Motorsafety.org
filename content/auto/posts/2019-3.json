Some affected vehicles may have a door match motor malfunction intermittently resulting in the door latch failing to engage.</p>\n","description":"<p>Laguna Hills, CA &#8211; March 27, 2019 &#8211; Ford Motor Company is recalling certain 2017-2019 Lincoln Continental vehicles. The affected vehicles may have an intermittently functioning door latch motor due to the buildup of silicon contamination, resulting in the door latch not fully engaging. As many as 27,609 vehicles may be affected by this issue.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V077-9885.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report</a> on this problem, the door-latch motors may not operate correctly, potentially resulting in a door not closing completely. A&nbsp;latch that is not fully engaged may allow the door to open suddenly while driving, increasing the risk of injury.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>The first report of this issue occurred in June 2018 when the Ford data analysis group informed the North American Critical Concerns Review Group of a small number of incidents involving doors that would not close and doors that opened while driving. None of these reports alleged any accidents, injuries or loss of vehicle contents as a result. Engineering then began an initiative to recover the electronic door latch system components from complaint vehicles for suppliers to analyze.</p>\n<p>From July through August, an examination of returned parts from the field showed a diagnostic trouble code indicating out of position parts. The customer concern could not be duplicated, however, when the same parts were later tested on a bench or in a vehicle. As part of this investigation,&nbsp;quality control personnel attempted&nbsp;to duplicate the latch performance concerns under various system and electrical conditions, as well as looking at other causes such as component assembly, vehicle level assembly, cable interaction and door alignment. Additional component testing was also done to reproduce the customer allegations and trouble codes, including high and low temperature soaking and cycling.</p>\n<p>From September through November, lab analysis revealed small amounts of silicon dioxide on the latch motor commutator, as well as the presence of silicon within the potting material on the printed circuit board of a door latch. As a result, Ford continued its assessment of silicon dioxide contamination on system function.</p>\n<p>Based on theoretical engineering analysis from December 2018 to January 2019, Ford felt that it could be possible for a door latch motor contaminated with silicon dioxide to stop its rotation in a way that the latch striker would only be partially engaged. Field data also showed an increase in door latch repairs from September through December 2018.</p>\n<p>Ford subsequently contacted dealers and customers to better understand the nature of these repairs and customer experiences. Based on a detailed engineering review of the latch assembly design and performance, Ford felt that if any key component of the latch system were out of position, the driver would receive door ajar warnings and notifications, including a door&nbsp;perceived to be closed that was actually&nbsp;unlatched or in a partially latched condition.</p>\n<p>Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee addressed the matter Feb. 4, 2019 and approved a field action. The automaker is not aware of any reports of accident or injury related to this condition.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>The recall began March 2019. Ford is notifying Lincoln Continental owners, and dealers will replace the latch assemblies on all four doors, free of charge.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332.

As many as 205 vehicles may be affected by this issue.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V097-2891.pdf\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Safety Recall Report </a>on this issue, the fuel filler pipe may not have been properly reconnected to the fuel tank during an inspection after vehicle assembly. As a result, the improperly connected filler pipe could leak fuel, resulting in an increased risk of fire.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Toyota received two reports from dealers in January 2019 describing fuel leaking underneath the vehicle during refueling. The automaker began an investigation into the issue and found that the vehicles in these two reports had been part of a group of vehicles&nbsp;involved in an inspection for potential replacement of the fuel filler pipe prior to dealer delivery. The inspection was described as a quality confirmation activity.</p>\n<p>Toyota then began a field survey to inspect additional vehicles that had been part of this quality confirmation activity. As a result of the survey, two additional vehicles with the same disconnected fuel filler pipe issue were identified.</p>\n<p>Based on the investigation, quality confirmation activity team interviews and a review of the vehicle design drawings, Toyota determined that the vehicles did not meet certain U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standard requirements, and so decided to conduct a recall beginning in March 2019.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The recall will begin March 2019. Toyota will notify all known owners of affected vehicles by April 15, 2019. Owners will be told to return their vehicles to a Toyota dealer for inspection of the fuel filler pipe. If it turns out that the pipe had been improperly connected or unsecured, the dealer will replace the fuel filler pipe with a new one at no cost, as the repair would be covered under Toyota&#8217;s new vehicle warranty.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-888-270-9371.

It then began a review of other electrified vehicle lines, halting shipment of affected vehicles while the investigation continued. Upon discovering that a unique plastic cover for the bus electrical center had been installed on similar vehicles sold in Europe, Ford then incorporated this cover in the production of its North American electrified vehicles.</p>\n<p>Ford determined in Jan. 2019 that further evaluation of the Fusion Energi performance was needed, and contacted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to discuss requirements and assessment methods associated with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard for electrical shock protection, which had gone into effect Sept. 2018.</p>\n<p>Ford and NHTSA reviewed testing alternatives Feb. 6 and Feb. 8, 2019. Incorporating this new input, Ford conducted testing Feb. 11 and found that contact with an uncovered high voltage fuse through an access panel gap was possible using a wire test probe.</p>\n<p>Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee then reviewed the concern Feb. 13, 2019 and approved a field action. The automaker is not aware of any reports of accident or injury related to this condition.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Starting April 1, 2019, owners will be notified by mail and instructed to take their vehicle to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to have a bus electrical center cover installed over the high voltage fuses.

At least 22 people were killed and hundreds permanently disfigured when the air bags exploded after deployment, spraying them with deadly shrapnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeline of events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honda began using the Takata-made driver-side air bag inflators June 2014 as part of a regional safety improvement campaign. By March 2015, when the scope of the original Takata recall expanded, Honda began obtaining remedy air bag inflators from other manufacturers to supplement its supply of replacement parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honda instructed dealers to stop installing the Takata inflators July 2016, and stopped ordering the replacement parts from Takata.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 21, 2018, Honda was informed of the Jan.&nbsp;19, 2018 crash in which the driver air bag inflator had allegedly ruptured during air bag deployment; an initial incident report was then submitted to NHTSA March 23. A joint field inspection April 10 confirmed the driver air bag inflator had ruptured, and a final rupture incident report was sent to NHTSA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From mid-April to early-February 2019, Honda continued its investigation in conjunction with the air bag inflator supplier and NHTSA.

The automaker then decided on&nbsp;March 6 that a defect existed, launching the recall process as a result.

In some of these vehicles, the transmission shift lever can be moved from the &#8220;Park&#8221; position without the key in the starter and without depressing the brake pedal, raising concerns about theft protection as well as safety. As many as 2,992 vehicles could be affected.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>According to the<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCAK-19V071-9645.pdf\"> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Safety Recall Report</a> on this issue,&nbsp; the brake transmission shift interlock override plunger may be depressed, allowing the shifter to&nbsp;move&nbsp;from the &#8220;park&#8221; position without the key in the starting system and without depressing the brake pedal. As a result, if the vehicle is able to be shifted out of Park without the brake applied, it may unexpectedly move, increasing the risk of injury or crash.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>The issue first came&nbsp;to Ford&#8217;s attention Jan.&nbsp;10, 2019. The report of a 2019 Ranger shifting out of park without a key in the ignition&nbsp;or a depressed&nbsp;brake pedal was reviewed by Ford&#8217;s Critical Concerns Review Group, following a Jan. 8&nbsp;vehicle audit at Ford&#8217;s Michigan Assembly Plant.</p>\n<p>Ford&#8217;s engineering investigation revealed that the PRNDL bezel wiring on the vehicle interfered with the BTSI plunger. As the result of a subsequent inspection of 985 vehicles at the Michigan Plant, the problem was also found in a second vehicle. Over 100 more vehicles at a different Ford facility were also inspected, with no additional evidence of the issue.</p>\n<p>Ford then began a review of the vehicle assembly process and post-assembly vehicle update procedures, uncovering three more vehicles at the Michigan Assembly Plant with this condition, which were repaired.</p>\n<p>A dealer warranty claim regarding a shifter interlock actuator repair was reported Jan.&nbsp;21, with the Ford Field Review Committee reviewing the concern and approving a field action. Ford has not yet&nbsp;received any reports of accident or injury as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of this issue.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>The recall was announced February 22 when Ford began notifying owners by mail. Owners are instructed to take their vehicle to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to verify proper shifter interlock functionality. If a vehicle fails either inspection, dealers will inspect for wiring interference with the interlock switch plunger and relocate the wiring as needed. There will be no charge for this service.</p>\n<p>Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332. Ford&#8217;s number for this recall is 19C02.

Ford supplier Visteon had discovered a potential problem with 2 GB memory chips in the Instrument Panel Cluster causing a failure of data to load properly, resulting in a blank display. The issue surfaced during bench testing at higher temperatures. Ford then initiated a shipping freeze for all affected vehicles while the problem was investigated.</p>\n<p>During the following month, the Ford team reviewed and confirmed a potential data transfer timing issue between the 2 GB memory chip and the graphics processor. The team worked with the supplier and three assembly plants to identify the affected vehicles, while the Engineering team searched field data for reports related to this issue. Ford found one warranty report.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 4, 2019, the Ford Field Review Committee announced a compliance recall action for all affected vehicles.

Consequently, connector terminals inside the plastic molding may have insufficient isolation between terminals. If a loss in isolation happens, the EPS warning lamp will light and the EPS assist may be disabled. When this occurs, steering will become more difficult, increasing the risk of a crash.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Timeline of Events</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subaru received the first report of a vehicle experiencing loss of power steering assist </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Jan. 8, 2019. The report came from a transport truck driver who had just restarted the engine to load the vehicle for transportation. The problem occurred before the vehicle was in motion. Subaru requested part collection to begin a supplier investigation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This comes after a separate </span><a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/steering-column-shaft-problems-prompt-new-subaru-recalls/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016 Subaru steering column shaft recall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that dealt with steering issues on the 2016 and 2017 Subaru Legacy &amp; Outback models. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following week, Subaru received ten additional incidents of vehicles with disabled EPS assist. In all ten new cases, the issue happened shortly after the engine was restarted but prior to driving the vehicle, similar to the original occurrence. All eleven of these cases surfaced in Japan, while still under the automaker&#8217;s control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Investigation proceeded with a supplier-conducted examination of the failed parts, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">review of the manufacturing process</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and an inquiry into the history of the composition of raw materials involved in the connector&#8217;s fabrication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Jan. 16, Subaru received the first report of this problem occurring while a vehicle was in motion. Like the previous incidents, the failure was reported by a transport truck driver while the vehicle was still in Japan under manufacturer control. As a result, all production and shipping of potentially affected vehicles </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> halted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subaru of America subsequently placed a hold on these vehicles on Jan. 21. Since all the vehicles were in the shipping process and hadn&#8217;t yet arrived in the U.S., the hold kept the automobiles at their various ports of entry. Back in Japan, a safety recall was announced </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Jan.30 by Subaru for the Japanese market, because some of the potentially affected Forester and Crosstrek vehicles had already been sold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the U.S., Subaru went ahead with distribution of the vehicles to retailers beginning Feb. 4, so that dealers could make repairs.

The vehicles may have a deformed fuel tank, resulting in the raised height of the fuel pump causing the fuel level float to stick.&nbsp;This could lead to inaccurate fuel levels displayed on the fuel gauge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The defect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V052-4070.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Safety Recall Report</a>, an improper manufacturing process produced deformities in the bottom of certain fuel tanks, which could raise the fuel pump height, decreasing the clearance between the fuel float and the inner wall of the tank. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuel movement in the tank can then cause the float to stick along the inner wall, leading to incorrect gauge readings. In a worst-case scenario, the vehicle could run out of fuel and stall, potentially increasing the risk of a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeline of events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honda received the first report of an inaccurate fuel gauge in February 2018. At that time, troubleshooting did not result in tank replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following additional reports of inaccurate fuel gauge readings, investigation continued from October 2018 through January 2019. Recreation tests by the supplier confirmed the problem, and revealed that an inappropriate cooling jig adjustment setting was used during a specific production period, resulting in the deformed tanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further review also showed an inadequate cooling water flow rate during another phase of&nbsp;production, separate from the one in which the original fuel tank problems occurred. Records from this time confirmed that the tanks shrank and deformed due to the improper flow rate of&nbsp;cooling water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 17, 2019, Honda determined that a motor vehicle safety defect existed, and decided to issue a safety recall. As of that date, Honda had received 621 warranty claims and 264 field reports. However, no reports of crashes or injuries related to this issue have been received.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RMISC-19V052-5536.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">statement issued Feb. 8</a>, Acura announced that it is voluntarily recalling 4,455 model-year 2014-2019 ILX vehicles in the U.S. for inspection and, if needed, complimentary&nbsp;replacement of the fuel tanks, free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acura is encouraging owners of affected vehicles to bring them to an authorized dealer for repair as soon as they receive notification from Acura.

The issue may result in the failure of other essential features, including anti-lock brakes.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>November 18, 2021</em> <em>UPDATE</em> – Subaru Corporation (OTCMKTS:FUJHY) has<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=19V149\"> </a>remedied 993,791 Subaru vehicles with brake light issues such as the 2013 Subaru Crosstrek. 974 vehicles have been deemed unreachable with an additional 34,370 vehicles removed from Subaru’s brake light recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Camden, NJ – February 19, 2019</em> – Subaru Corporation (OTCMKTS:FUJHY) has recalled 1,303,530 vehicles, due to faulty brake lights. If brake lights do not illuminate as designed, other vehicles will not be alerted when the vehicle is slowing or stopping. This issue increases the risk of a crash. This mirrors a <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/nissan-sentras-recalled-for-brake-light-malfunction/\">2021 Nissan Recall of 807,376 Nissan Sentra vehicles with malfunctioning brake lights</a>. The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2014-2016 Subaru Forester SUVs</li><li>2008-2016 Subaru Impreza sedans</li><li>2012-2016 Subaru Impreza station wagons</li><li>2008-2014 Subaru WRX sedans (including STI)</li><li>2013-2017 Subaru Crosstrek SUVs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The brake light switch is built inside of a housing and turns the lights on and off. In recalled vehicles, contaminants may seep into the switch housing and disable it. The brake will still work even if the light switch is not operating correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But depending on the model, the failure<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V149-4588.PDF\"> </a>may also result in the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2019/RCLRPT-19V149-4588.PDF\">inability to start the Subaru Forester, Impreza, WRX, or Crosstrek or shift out of “Park”</a> when trying to go somewhere. In some cases, it may also disable the anti-lock brake (ABS) system and some important safety features, including EyeSight driver-assist and vehicle dynamics control (VDC). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Warning signs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The vehicle should display an appropriate warning light if any of the above systems malfunction.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Subaru Forester recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forestor platform was involved in a December 2019 recall when the <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/subaru-recalls-vehicles-due-to-risk-of-engine-stall/\">2019 Subaru Forester struggle with stalling issues</a> and earlier that year for <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/SUBARU/FORESTER#recalls\">Forester’s loss of electric power assist</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trailing vehicles must be alerted when the driver applies the brakes. If the brake light is out, the risk of a rear-end collision greatly increases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the vehicle’s ABS fails, the brake pedal may become unresponsive. Both this and the loss of other essential safety features – such as EyeSight driver assist, which helps the driver to stay in his or her lane – augments the risk of crash and subsequent injury or death to the occupants of the car and other people on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, dealers will need to replace the brake light switch. The repair is free of charge and is available now. The Subaru brake light switch replacement is expected to take 30 minutes, but your dealer may need to keep your vehicle longer, depending on scheduling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 1,300,000 vehicles were originally included in this Subaru recall. As of October 2020 – the last date for which information is available – close to a million have been fixed or removed.
