The recall includes <strong>2004-2006 Ford ranger pickups.</strong></p>\n<h2>Recall Summary</h2>\n<p>These air bags were made by a company called Takata, and used a chemical called PSAN as an inflator accelerant in the event of a crash. However, exposure to extreme conditions could have led that gas to degrade the air bags&#8217; structural integrity over time. This is the third recall of affected vehicles, the first of which <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2014/RCMN-14V787-0628.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brought owners a temporary solution</a> for the issue and the second <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM479516/RCLRPT-15V322-3873.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broadened the scope</a> of the initial action.</p>\n<p>Ford is unsure how many of the hundreds of thousands of vehicles in the recall are affected by this issue. All these Ranger pickups were produced from March 24, 2003 to May 4, 2006. Mazda is currently undergoing a recall for late-model light trucks over the same issue as well.</p>\n<p>Due to the potentially corrosive properties of the ammonium nitrate gas PSAN in conditions with extreme temperature, humidity and so on, the inflators for passenger frontal air bags in the affected Ford Rangers could rupture in the event of a crash that leads to deployment of those air bags.</p>\n<p>As a consequence, metal fragments could launch into the passenger compartment at potentially high speeds, greatly increasing the risk of injury or even death.</p>\n<p>Ford previously issued a recall for these vehicles in 2016, and this action is intended to provide a final fix for the problem. The issue was first noted in May 2015, when Takata submitted a noticed to the NHTSA about the air bag inflator issue, which prompted Ford to examine the potential effects on its own vehicles.</p>\n<p>On May 26, 2015, Ford&#8217;s Field Review Committee completed its investigation of the issue and approved the recall action.</p>\n<p>The recall filing for the final remedy to the air bag problem was issued Dec. 11, 2017.</p>\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n<p>Owners will be notified by mail about the recall and will be instructed to take their late-model Rangers to a local Ford or Lincoln dealership where the frontal air bag inflators will be replaced free of charge. However, the automaker is not including reimbursement plans as part of this recall because it would have been covered by the original warranty.</p>\n<p>Dealers were notified of the recall Dec. 12, 2017, and owners were slated to receive notifications by mail in phases between Dec. 26, 2017, and March 31, 2018. The first phase of notifications was only slated to last from Dec. 26 to Dec. 31.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of the recall?</strong></h2>\n<p>Over 300,000 vehicles were originally part of this Ford Ranger recall. <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 164,779 airbags had been replaced.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:14595,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:10}\" data-sheets-formula=\"=Concatenate(&quot;As of &quot;,R[0]C[4],&quot; – the last date information was available – &quot;,R[0]C[11],&quot; airbags had been replaced.&quot;)\">As of April 9, 2021 – the last date information was available – 164,779 airbags had been replaced.</span><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As of April 9, 2021, 958,175 airbags had been replaced, with 400,346 remaining.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:769,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\"> </span>To see if your car still needs to be repaired, use MotorSafety’s<a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/\"> free lookup tool</a>.</p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12974","createdAt":"2017-12-29T07:28:08.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-29T21:13:08.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-24T07:08:25.000Z","modified_gmt":"2021-06-24T20:53:25.000Z","display_date":"December 29, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":"","meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","custom_schema":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-Pickup-truck-Ford-Range-768x499.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"2017-Pickup-truck-Ford-Range","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":4133,"title":"Hyundai Santa Fes Recalled for Common Side Air Bag Issue","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-santa-fes-recalled-common-side-air-bag-issue/","status":"publish","slug":"hyundai-santa-fes-recalled-common-side-air-bag-issue","excerpt":"<p>Recall Masters &#8211; December 28, 2017 Hyundai Santa Fes Recalled for Common Side Air Bag Issue Hyundai Motor America recently issued a recall order for more than 1,200 of its Santa Fe light sport utility vehicles from the 2018 model year, citing issues with a side curtain air bag inflator diffuser, according to a defect</p>\n","description":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.recallmasters.com/hyundai-santa-fes-recalled-common-side-air-bag-issue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Recall Masters &#8211; December 28, 2017</a></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Hyundai Santa Fes Recalled for Common Side Air Bag Issue</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.recallmasters.com/hyundai-santa-fes-recalled-common-side-air-bag-issue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium\" src=\"https://www.recallmasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Hyundai-Santa-Fes-Recalled-for-Common-Side-Airbag-Issue_16001385_40044469_0_14112987_500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\"></a></p>\n<p>Hyundai Motor America recently issued a recall order for more than 1,200 of its Santa Fe light sport utility vehicles from the 2018 model year, citing issues with a side curtain air bag inflator diffuser, according to a defect filing made with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.<br />\nThe issue specifically relates to the shape of the metal top-hat diffusers, which were not manufactured to specification.

Further, that information was used to identify affected Santa Fes that were already in dealer inventories or had been sold.</p>\n<p>Then, on Dec. 5, Hyundai completed a review of the information and decided to initiate a recall of the affected vehicles.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Hyundai will notify owners about the risk related to the recall and ask them to bring the SUVs to local Hyundai dealers, where both the driver and passenger side curtain air bags will be inspected and &#8211; if necessary &#8211; replaced free of charge. Owners who already incurred any repair costs as a result of this top-hat diffuser issue will also be reimbursed by the automaker.</p>\n<p>The company informed dealers of the recall on Dec. 20, 2017, and plans to notify owners on or around Feb. 9, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12963","createdAt":"2017-12-28T09:34:00.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-28T23:19:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T23:28:36.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T13:13:36.000Z","display_date":"December 28, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/metallic-red-Hyundai-Santa-Fe-4WD-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"metallic-red-Hyundai-Santa-Fe-4WD","category":{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":10,"name":"Hyundai","slug":"hyundai-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyundai_RM.png"}]},{"id":12955,"title":"Ford Recalling 2018 Escapes Over Side Airbag Diffuser Issue","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-recalling-2018-escapes-side-airbag-diffuser-issue-2/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-recalling-2018-escapes-side-airbag-diffuser-issue-2","excerpt":"<p>The Ford Motor Company recently issued a recall of more than 10,000 of its Escape light sport utility vehicles from the 2018 model year.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dearborn, Michigan &#8211; Dec. 28, 2017 &#8211; The Ford Motor Company recently <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V803-5019.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued a recall</a> of more than 10,000 of its Escape light sport utility vehicles from the 2018 model year, citing concerns over side curtain air&nbsp;bag inflator diffusers, according to a defect report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the issue relates to vehicles that have side curtain air&nbsp;bags installed on either the driver or passenger side, which contain top-hat diffusers on their inflators.

Due to an issue with the side curtain airbags. </p>\n","description":"<p>Irvine, Calif. &#8211; Dec. 27, 2017 &#8211; Kia Motors America recently announced a recall of <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V784-1130.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more than 2,000 of its Sorento light sport utility vehicles</a> from the 2018 model year, stemming from concerns related to assembly of their side curtain air bags, according to a defect filing made with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the vehicles have side curtain air bags for both the driver and passenger sides with diffusers that can detach from the inflators during the air bag deployment process, potentially launching them inside the vehicle at high velocities and increasing the risk of injury in a crash.</p>\n<p>All of the vehicles in the recall are expected to contain this production defect, and were manufactured from Sept. 5 to Nov. 29, 2017, but were not produced in VIN order.</p>\n<p>This same issue has also led to recalls for both Hyundai and Ford within the past month.</p>\n<h2>The Defect</h2>\n<p>All inflators in the Sorentos&#8217; side curtain air bags come with a top hat diffuser, but in some of these vehicles &#8211; i.e. those in the recall &#8211; the manufacturing process saw the company install improperly formed diffusers. As such, when a crash that would deploy the side curtain airbags takes place, the diffuser can detach from the inflator and enter the occupant compartment, increasing risk of injury.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for owners, there is no way for them to determine whether this risk will apply to their vehicles unless they receive the recall notices.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>\n<p>On Nov. 18, a supplier of the diffusers identified and contained the potentially defective diffusers and began using only correct parts in side curtain airbag assemblies going forward.</p>\n<p>Nine days later, on Nov. 27, the supplier <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V784-8140.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">informed Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia</a> of the potential issue with the improperly formed diffusers. The following day, KMMG stopped release of 2018 Sorentos that had potentially been equipped with the side curtain airbag assemblies with defective diffusers and notified Kia Motors Corporation of the issue.</p>\n<p>Then on Dec. 1, Kia Motors made the decision to recall the 2,000-plus affected vehicles, despite the fact that there were no reported accidents or injuries for the affected vehicles.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>All owners of the affected vehicles received notification of the recall via the mail, with instructions to bring their Sorentos to a local Kia dealer. There, the dealers will replace both the driver and passenger side curtain airbags with new and improved models that have proper diffusers. These repairs will be made free of charge, and Kia will also reimburse any drivers who incurred out-of-pocket repair costs for this issue previous to the recall being announced.</p>\n<p>Dealers first learned of the recall on Dec. 11, while owners of the affected vehicles got their notifications on Dec. 13.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12957","createdAt":"2017-12-27T08:07:20.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-27T21:52:20.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T00:53:58.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-27T14:38:58.000Z","display_date":"December 27, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"17V784000","recall_date":"December 8, 2017"},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KIA-768x510.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"KIA","category":{"id":32,"name":"Kia","slug":"kia-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kia_RM.png"},"tags":[{"id":1720,"name":"2018 Kia Sorento recall","slug":"2018-kia-sorento-recall"},{"id":1679,"name":"Kia airbag recall","slug":"kia-airbag-recall"}],"categories":[{"id":32,"name":"Kia","slug":"kia-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kia_RM.png"}]},{"id":12931,"title":"Audi Recalling A6 and A7 Vehicles Over Fuel Line Issues","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/audi-recalling-a6-a7-vehicles-fuel-line-issues-2/","status":"publish","slug":"audi-recalling-a6-a7-vehicles-fuel-line-issues-2","excerpt":"<p>Volkswagen Group of America recently announced that it would recall nearly 49,000 Audi A6 and A7 executive cars from model years 2012 to 2014, over concerns about the potential for a leaking fuel line.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auburn Hills, Michigan &#8211; Dec. 26, 2017 &#8211; Volkswagen Group of America recently announced that it would <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V781-4912.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recall nearly 49,000 Audi A6 and A7 executive cars</a>&nbsp;from model years 2012 to 2014, over concerns about the potential for a leaking fuel line, according to a defect report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>The issue stems from a compression point in the design of the fuel line that was supposed to facilitate installation. However, that part of the fuel line may weaken over time due to issues in the manufacturing process, potentially leading to a leak.</p>\n<p>The vehicles in question were produced from March 28, 2011, to Sept. 13, 2013, and 100 percent of the A6s and A7s&nbsp;in the recall are affected by the issue.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The defect was first noticed as far back as the middle of 2013, but various intermediate fixes were apparently not effective in fully reducing the risk of a fuel line leak. In fact, various attempted fixes may have exacerbated the problem in certain situations. The fuel line was manufactured by a parts supplier based in Denmark, but many of the fixes were made by Audi on the basis of software updates to the vehicles&#8217; internal gearbox computer.</p>\n<p>Leaking fuel could lead to a fire or explosion if in the presence of an ignition source. Drivers or vehicle occupants may be able to spot this issue by noticing a gasoline smell, or puddles under their vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In 2013, Audi began receiving reports of A6 and A7 vehicles that had the 3.0TFSI engine installed, prompting an investigation by the company. In June 2014, with reports of leaking fuel lines increasing, the company&#8217;s Product Safety Committee received more information on the issue and made the decision to update the gearboxes&#8217; software, with an eye toward reducing vibration and strain on the fuel lines. Monitoring of the issue continued even after this point.</p>\n<p>From March 2015 to April 2017, more information came in that some Audi vehicles were still suffering the same type of damage even after getting the gearbox software update. Once again, the Product Safety Committee received the latest data on the investigation and conducted more field analysis.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, the company&#8217;s laboratory analyzed 11 fuel lines, none of which showed any damage, but later that month and into November, more incidents were reported.</p>\n<p>Then on Nov. 29, the Product Safety Committee completed further analysis and determined it was time to recall the vehicles in question.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Audi drivers whose vehicles are affected by the recall will be able to take them to their local Audi dealerships or other locations for free repairs. The company will also offer reimbursement to owners who already paid to have these issues fixed.</p>\n<p>The replacement fuel lines have a redesigned fuel hose that shrinks during installation instead of being compressed.</p>\n<p>Both dealers and owners will be formally informed of the recall on Feb. 5, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12931","createdAt":"2017-12-26T06:39:15.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-26T20:24:15.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T23:51:45.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T13:36:45.000Z","display_date":"December 26, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Audi-A6-S-line-C8-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Audi-A6-S-line-C8","category":{"id":16,"name":"Audi","slug":"audi-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/audi_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":16,"name":"Audi","slug":"audi-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/audi_RM.png"},{"id":6,"name":"Volkswagen","slug":"volkswagen-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/volkswagen.png"}]},{"id":4124,"title":"Mercedes-Benz recalls vehicles for power steering problem [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-vehicles-power-steering-problem-video/","status":"publish","slug":"mercedes-benz-recalls-vehicles-power-steering-problem-video","excerpt":"<p>Recall Masters &#8211; December 22, 2017 Mercedes-Benz recalls vehicles for power steering problem [Video] Mercedes-Benz USA recently issued a recall for 72 vehicles from the 2017 model year, including E 300 sedans, S 65 AMG coupes, and Maybach S 600s.

From Nov. 3 to 16, the company contacted its supplier to investigate the issue, and during that time the supplier identified a change to its polymer mix cycle times for those stoppers made on Feb. 28, 2014. That investigation found that pads with shorter cycle times would likely have less durability.</p>\n<p>As such, on Nov. 24, Kia decided to issue the safety recall based on 183 warranty claims and two complaints from owners of their brake lights staying on even after they took pressure off the brakes in their vehicles from the 2014 model year.

This issue may result in fuel leaking from the tank and, if near an ignition source, could result in fire.</p>\n<p>In all, 50 percent of the vehicles in the recall are expected to have experienced this problem. The vehicles in question were produced between May 16, 2017, and June 10, 2017.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Due to a production problem with the supplier YAPP, fuel tanks built within a short period of time may not have the proper wall thickness in certain areas, with these thin spots stemming from &#8220;undetected material starvation during the manufacturing process.&#8221; The problem was spotted and corrected in short order on the manufacturer&#8217;s end, but not noticed by a Volkswagen dealer until several months later.</p>\n<p>The best way for owners to determine if their vehicle is affected by this issue is if they smell gasoline while in or around their vehicles, or if they notice fuel puddles under their vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On Sept. 15, 2017, Volkswagen opened an investigation into the issue after receiving a claim from a dealer about the potential defect. On Sept. 28, a test of the affected fuel tanks&#8217; wall thickness was proposed as a temporary solution, and on Oct. 5, the company began weighing both the tanks and the waste flash together to determine the total amount of material that had been present during the manufacturing process.</p>\n<p>A little more than two months after the investigation began, on Nov. 22, Volkswagen&#8217;s Product Safety Committee received more information&nbsp;from its investigators and determined to issue the recall based on the findings.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>All vehicles affected by the recall are still within the automaker&#8217;s New Vehicle Limited Warranty, and owners will therefore be able to&nbsp;have the defect fixed free of charge at a dealership.

That, in turn, can increase the risk of crashes and injuries.</p>\n<p>In all, 100 percent of the recalled vehicles are expected to have this issue, one from the 2015 model year, five from 2016, and the rest from either 2017 or 2018. These vehicles were produced from Dec. 5, 2014, to Oct. 26, 2017.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>Southeast Toyota Distributors began receiving accessory billet grille overlays in October 2014, but in mid-July 2017 those kits began coming with revised U-nuts treated with phosphate. Soon after, the organization began receiving reports from technicians about fractures, as well as two field reports in which the U-nuts fractured. However, only the newer U-nuts have reportedly fractured.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In November 2017, reports of these issues started to come into Southeast Toyota Dealers, leading to the company contacting the grille overlay supplier, T-Rex Truck Products in Corona, California. However, neither company could replicate the conditions that led to the phosphate-treated U-nuts fracturing, even when applying torque above and beyond normal conditions. Despite that, SET has issued a recall for all vehicles with the grille overlay made since the revised U-nut was added to the kit.</p>\n<p>Beginning Nov. 20, the parts supplier is issuing new hardware for the grille overlay kits.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>SET is currently working with IHS Automotive to get as much current contact information for owners of the 4Runners in the recall, and will mail recall notification letters on or around Jan. 26, 2018. Dealers were already notified in late November.</p>\n<p>Owners who take the vehicles into local dealerships will have the U-nuts replaced with upgraded hardware free of charge.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12677","createdAt":"2017-12-19T08:24:29.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-19T22:09:29.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T23:58:47.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T13:43:47.000Z","display_date":"December 19, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Toyota-4Runner-SUV-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Toyota-4Runner-SUV","category":{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":17,"name":"Toyota","slug":"toyota-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/toyota_ms.png"}]},{"id":12658,"title":"Jeep Compasses recalled over instrument panel lighting","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/jeep-compasses-recalled-instrument-panel-lighting/","status":"publish","slug":"jeep-compasses-recalled-instrument-panel-lighting","excerpt":"<p>Chrysler recently issued a recall of nearly 26,000 Jeep Compass sport utility vehicles.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auburn Hills, Michigan &#8211; Dec. 15, 2017 &#8211; Chrysler recently issued a recall of <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V740-1368.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nearly 26,000 Jeep Compass sport utility vehicles</a> from the 2017 and 2018 model years over concerns related to the photo sensor calibrations that may lead to the instrument panel not lighting up during day-to-night transitions, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>Federal vehicle safety standards require that backlighting for dashboard panels come with at least two brightness settings, but this issue means some Compasses may not meet that standard.

Five days later, the company&#8217;s Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization started that investigation after reviewing a number of similar complaints and records, and in doing so identified the engineering changes that affected the dimmer.</p>\n<p>The same day, Chrysler and the supplier of the parts in question reviewed the light sensor performance to determine just how widespread the issue might have been, then began a thorough search of part numbers and vehicle ID numbers to determine the plants from which these problems may have arisen.</p>\n<p>By Oct. 31, Chrysler and the supplier reviewed a sample field return of the panel cluster, and on Nov. 31, Chrysler&#8217;s Vehicle Regulations Committee determined it would initiate a recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Chrysler plans to reimburse owners for any costs they incur &#8211; or have already incurred &#8211; repairing the issues in the recall, and asks Compass owners send the original receipt or other proof of payment to confirm the cost.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 21, Chrysler announced it would notify both dealers and owners of the recall on Jan. 10, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12658","createdAt":"2017-12-15T08:03:24.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-15T21:48:24.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T23:36:40.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T13:21:40.000Z","display_date":"December 15, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Jeep-Compass-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Jeep-Compass","category":{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"}]},{"id":12636,"title":"Chrysler recalling nearly 27,000 Jeep Compasses","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalling-nearly-27000-jeep-compasses/","status":"publish","slug":"chrysler-recalling-nearly-27000-jeep-compasses","excerpt":"<p>Fiat Chrysler USA recently announced the recall of 26,971 Jeep Compasses from the 2018 model year.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auburn Hills, Michigan &#8211; Dec. 14, 2017 &#8211; Fiat Chrysler USA recently announced the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V732-5138.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recall of 26,971 Jeep Compasses</a> from the 2018 model year, over concerns that there may be loose inflator mounting nuts in the passenger airbag module assembly.</p>\n<p>Specifically, it is believed that a small number of the 2018 Compasses were manufactured outside of specification, with some vehicles having a box of inflator mounting nuts kept above the module assembly area before the airbag inflator was installed. In those instances, nuts could be resting within the airbag assembly and, in case of a crash and airbag deployment, those nuts could become projectiles and significantly increasing the potential for injury.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s expected that this defect impacts only about 1 percent of the vehicles in the recall, and all of them were produced between Sept. 4 and Nov. 19, 2017.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The issue was first noticed when Chrysler&#8217;s Supplier Quality Engineering organization noted a rattle inside the instrument panel of one of the vehicles that would later be&nbsp;recalled. That prompted an investigation, which determined that with the box resting above the assembly area, it was possible for loose nuts to fall into module assembly due to its having multiple openings.</p>\n<p>In the event of a crash in which the airbags deploy, it&#8217;s possible that these nuts would be launched at high velocity toward an occupant, even through the cushion of the airbag itself.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>Chrysler&#8217;s SQE reported the initial concern about the rattling in the instrument panel on in early November, prompting an investigation from the company&#8217;s Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization. Once the cause of the potential issue was determined within the manufacturing process, it was discovered that five airbag module assemblies &#8211; all produced between Oct. 20 and Nov. 2, 2017 &#8211; were found to have loose mounting nuts inside. Of those five, two of the assemblies had the nuts outside the fabric of the airbag itself.</p>\n<p>Then, on Nov. 17, the company determined it would conduct a recall of the affected vehicles.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Chrysler is conducting a voluntary recall to replace all the airbag module assemblies for the vehicles in the recall, and will reimburse drivers for any repair costs they incur getting the airbag problem remedied. It asks that any proof of payment, such as the receipt for the transaction, be forwarded to the company.</p>\n<p>The automaker announced in late November that it would notify both dealers and vehicle owners of the recall on Jan. 10, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12636","createdAt":"2017-12-14T08:02:04.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-14T21:47:04.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T23:37:00.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T13:22:00.000Z","display_date":"December 14, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Jeep-Compass-4X4-model-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Jeep-Compass-4X4-model","category":{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":33,"name":"Jeep","slug":"jeep-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jeep_ms.png"}]},{"id":12561,"title":"Ford issues massive F-150, Explorer recall","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/ford-issues-massive-f-150-explorer-recall/","status":"publish","slug":"ford-issues-massive-f-150-explorer-recall","excerpt":"<p>The Ford Motor Company recently issued a recall for more than 177,000 vehicles from the 2016 model year.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dearborn, Michigan &#8211; Dec. 13, 2017 &#8211; The Ford Motor Company recently issued a recall for <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V767-6783.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more than 177,000 vehicles from the 2016 model year</a>, for both F-150s and Explorers, stemming from concerns over power seats for both drivers and front-seat passengers.</p>\n<p>For both types of seats, there is a concern with the upper left pivot bolt, which can loosen and fall out.

On Nov. 20, the company&#8217;s Field Review Committee approved field action on the recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Ford encourages F-150 owners with affected vehicles to call its toll-free hotline at 1-866-436-7332 or contact a local dealer that can give them more information from the company&#8217;s online database. This is important because the vehicles in question were not produced in VIN order, meaning that some may be affected while others are not.</p>\n<p>Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail that they should take the trucks to their local dealers to measure the torque on power seat pivot link bolts. If the bolt passes the assessment, dealers will remove and clean it, apply a new threadlock and re-install it. However, if it fails the inspection, another threadlock will be added until parts are available for a final repair, slated to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. All these efforts will be completed free of charge, and Ford will also reimburse drivers for any repairs they covered out-of-pocket before the safety recall.</p>\n<p>Dealers were first notified of the recall on Nov. 30, 2017, and owner notifications should arrive between Jan. 15 and Jan. 19, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12561","createdAt":"2017-12-13T05:48:40.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-13T19:33:40.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T00:01:35.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T13:46:35.000Z","display_date":"December 13, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ford-Explorerd-768x486.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Ford-Explorerd","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":12555,"title":"Mazda announces recalls for CX-5 over trailer hitches","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/mazda-announces-recalls-cx-5-trailer-hitches/","status":"publish","slug":"mazda-announces-recalls-cx-5-trailer-hitches","excerpt":"<p>Mazda North America recently issued a recall for nearly 1,100 CX-5 sport utility vehicles.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Washington, D.C. &#8211; Dec. 13, 2017 &#8211; Mazda North America recently issued a recall for <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V744-8865.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nearly 1,100 CX-5 sport utility vehicles</a> from the 2017 model year, citing an issue with genuine Mazda trailer hitch harness accessories.</p>\n<p>Specifically, as a result of inappropriate routing of that harness, there may not be enough space between the harness itself and the main exhaust silencer. Consequently, if the exhaust silencer and trailer harness come into contact with each other during operation of the vehicle, it could lead to damage to the harness that causes its internal wires to short-circuit.</p>\n<p>All CX-5s in the recall were produced between Oct. 27, 2016, and Oct. 31, 2017, and 100 percent of the vehicles in the recall are expected to be affected by it.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Defect</strong></h3>\n<p>If the wires in the trailer harness short-circuit, it can lead to failure of the trailer&#8217;s turn signals, tail lights and brake lights, which can increase the risk of accident &#8211; and injury &#8211; because trailing traffic may not be able to determine that the CX-5 intends to turn or is slowing down. However, the lights&nbsp;themselves are not affected directly by the defect.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In late September 2017, a Mazda employee noticed that the tail lights on an affected trailer were not working properly during an installation inspection, prompting an investigation the next day. That inspection found that the trailer hitch wire had been melted, and the fuse blow in the harness circuit. Another vehicle was also discovered to have the same problem, which led to a field report being issued, and a companywide investigation started in early October.</p>\n<p>Then, on Nov. 15, Mazda&#8217;s Quality Audit Committee decided to issue a recall for all affected CX-5s.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Dealers received the recall notifications on Nov. 30, and owners will be notified by Jan. 20, 2018. Those owners will be able to take their cars to local Mazda dealers for repairs, conducted free of charge. In the event that a trailer harness has been damaged, it will be replaced, and in either event, will be rerouted away from the exhaust silencer.</p>\n<p>So far, Mazda has been able to identify 826 vehicle ID numbers with associated trailer hitch harness kits, but those accessories are not always traceable within the company&#8217;s systems, so dealers are being asked to contact purchasers directly.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12555","createdAt":"2017-12-13T05:04:58.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-13T18:49:58.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T00:02:20.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-04T13:47:20.000Z","display_date":"December 13, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Car-Mazda-CX-5-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"Car-Mazda-CX-5","category":{"id":18,"name":"Mazda","slug":"mazda-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mazda.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":18,"name":"Mazda","slug":"mazda-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mazda.png"}]},{"id":12483,"title":"Chrysler recalling thousands of vans over impact sensors","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/chrysler-recalling-thousands-vans-impact-sensors/","status":"publish","slug":"chrysler-recalling-thousands-vans-impact-sensors","excerpt":"<p>Chrysler recently issued a recall order for more than 3,500 of its 2018 Ram ProMaster cargo vans.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Auburn Hills, Michigan &#8211; Dec. 12, 2017 &#8211; Chrysler recently <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V712-3670.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued a recall order</a> for more than 3,500 of its 2018 Ram ProMaster cargo vans, citing an issue with the vehicles&#8217; front door impact pressure sensors, according to a letter submitted to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>\n<p>The affected ProMaster vans have a new pressure sensor, but use the same fastening rivets as the vehicles with the older sensors, potentially leading to the driver&#8217;s side door airbags to unexpectedly deploy in certain situations. These vehicles were produced from late July to late August&nbsp;of&nbsp;2017. Only about 13 percent of the 2018 ProMasters are estimated to have this defect.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The existing fastening rivets in question were incorrectly fastened to the new sensors, which are designed to expand within a plastic attachment. Due to the incorrect installation, those sensor housings could fracture and potentially affect either sensor retention overall or the gasket seal-to-door area. If that happens, it could trigger the deployment of the driver&#8217;s door airbags in some crashes. That, in turn, could lead to additional injury risk for drivers.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>While production with the existing fastening rivets began&nbsp;July 24, the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V712-0561.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investigation into the potential flaw</a> did not begin until Aug. 18, initiated by Chrysler&#8217;s Manufacturing Quality organization. Two days later, the investigation determined that there was nothing materially wrong with either the rivets or sensors, so further information was sought. On Aug. 22, the rivet issue was discovered, prompting an effort to replace more than 1,300 affected vehicles built from Aug. 18 to 23 that were held back during the investigation.</p>\n<p>Then, on Sept. 20, the full investigation was completed, and found that because of how random the causes behind any potential fractures were, it was advisable to recall all 2018 ProMasters built before Aug. 23. Through early November, Chrysler was unaware of any accidents or injuries that may have stemmed from this defect.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Chrysler&#8217;s voluntary recall of the affected vehicles will replace both the front door impact pressure sensors, and fasten them with the proper rivets. The company will also ask in the letters it mails to affected owners that they include the receipts or other proof of payment for these repairs, so that it can reimburse customers for whatever expenses they incur.</p>\n<p>Both owners and dealers will be notified on or about Jan. 3, 2018.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://www.recallmasters.com/?p=12483","createdAt":"2017-12-12T09:49:52.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-12-12T23:34:52.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-27T23:37:35.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-28T13:22:35.000Z","display_date":"December 12, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":12,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/RAM-Promaster-City-768x576.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"RAM-Promaster-City","category":{"id":9,"name":"RAM","slug":"ram-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RAM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":9,"name":"RAM","slug":"ram-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RAM.png"}]},{"id":12478,"title":"Jaguar Land Rover recalls vehicles with defective instrument clusters [Video]","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/jaguar-land-rover-recalls-vehicles-defective-instrument-clusters-video/","status":"publish","slug":"jaguar-land-rover-recalls-vehicles-defective-instrument-clusters-video","excerpt":"<p>Land Rover(Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC) recalled 2017 Land Rover Range Rover and Range Rover Sports with faulty instrument clusters. </p>\n","description":"<p>Hello, and welcome to another vehicle recall update.</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has recalled more than twenty-one thousand vehicles potentially equipped with defective instrument clusters.

Currently, Toyota is unable to estimate what percentage of these vehicles were affected by the potential issues, noting in its filing, &#8221; Whether the condition will occur prior to first sale and constitute a noncompliance will differ depending on the environment and conditions that the vehicle is exposed to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not all of the vehicles in the recall were actually sold in the U.S., however, as the issues were first spotted in Japan.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The recall notice states that Toyota discovered a possibility the computer&nbsp;that controls the C-HR&#8217;s skid control function may &#8220;incorrectly identify a small increase in circuit resistance&#8221; due to a film applied to the electric parking brake motor&#8217;s open circuit. Most often, this is likely to occur when a parking brake hasn&#8217;t been used in a while.</p>\n<p>When this issue arises, the vehicle&#8217;s dashboard will light up, advising the driver that there has been an &#8220;EPB Malfunction&#8221; and that they should visit a dealer, as well as the inability to disengage the parking brake, or to apply it in the first place.</p>\n<p>The latter issue, in turn, creates a potential rollaway risk if vehicles are stopped on a significant enough slope and not put into park properly.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>The recall came in the wake of a few C-HRs in Japan reportedly having their EPBs stick after being applied, prompting an investigation into the issue from Toyota. As a result of that effort, which concluded in late October, the automaker determined the potential cause of the issue to be the oxide film on the EPB motor. However, C-HRs were not intended to go&nbsp;on sale in the U.S. before Nov. 9, so many of the issues might have cropped up before the vehicles got into consumers&#8217; hands.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Nonetheless, Toyota is issuing letters to all known owners of C-HRs to return their vehicles to the dealerships where the SUVs were purchased, for a quick, no-cost update to the programming on the skid control computer, rather than fixing anything to do with the EPB itself. All such repairs will fall well within the window of the company&#8217;s New Vehicle Limited Warranty. These notifications were expected to reach most owners by late November, but some could arrive as late as mid-January.</p>\n<p>For more information about the recall, owners will be able to call either Toyota&#8217;s hotline at&nbsp;1-800-331-4331, or the&nbsp;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236.
