These models have chassis cab/cutaways with medium wheelbases and medium, long and extended wheelbases.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nFord field testing showed&nbsp;that once the affected vehicles reach 30,000 miles, the driveshaft flexible coupling deteriorates. This issue can lead to driveline separation. As a result, the Transit can move while in park without the parking brake applied or lose motive power while driving. Damaged fuel and brake lines are also possible if the driveshaft separates from the transmission.</p>\n<p>So far, Ford has not associated any accidents or injuries with the defect, although such incidents are possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events&nbsp;</strong><br />\nAll the recalled vehicles originated from the company&#8217;s Kansas City Assembly Plant, with dates of manufacture ranging from Jan. 17, 2014 to June 15, 2017. Ford announced the recall June 28, 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nFord&nbsp;recalled the vehicles to replace the driveshaft flexible coupling. This interim repair is not necessary for affected models that have fewer than 30,000 miles. Additionally, the fix is not required for vans or buses with more than 30,000 miles that have had the coupling replaced within that mileage span.</p>\n<p>Until a final repair is available and complete, affected vehicles will need a replacement coupling every 30,000 miles. Ford will send mail notifications to owners, who can receive repairs at Ford or Lincoln dealers at no cost. When available, the permanent fix will also come at no cost, and Ford will again send a mail notification instructing owners to schedule a repair appointment for their Transit vehicles.<script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='' type='text/javascript'></script></p>\n","source":"https://recallmasters.com/?p=11141","createdAt":"2017-06-28T15:20:50.000Z","date_gmt":"2017-06-29T05:05:50.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-02T01:46:18.000Z","modified_gmt":"2020-10-02T15:31:18.000Z","display_date":"June 28, 2017","sticky":false,"recall":true,"authors":[{"id":9,"name":"admin","slug":"rm_admin"}],"acf":{"recall_master_id":"","nhtsa_campaign_number":"","recall_date":""},"year":2017,"month":6,"featured_image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_784437085-1-768x512.jpg","alt_text":"","cld_public_id":"shutterstock_784437085-1","category":{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"},"tags":[],"categories":[{"id":3,"name":"Ford","slug":"ford-recalls","image":"https://www.motorsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ford_RM.png"}]},{"id":11207,"title":"General Motors recalls vehicles with faulty front seats","link":"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-recalls-vehicles-faulty-front-seats/","status":"publish","slug":"general-motors-recalls-vehicles-faulty-front-seats","excerpt":"<p>General Motors has recalled more than 760 vehicles that may be equipped with unsafe front seat head restraints.</p>\n","description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Warren, Mich. &#8211; June 27, 2017 &#8211; General Motors has recalled more than 760 vehicles that may be equipped with unsafe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V404-9134.PDF\">front seat head restraints</a>, according to documentation filed with the&nbsp;National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. The campaign affects 2016-2017 Buick Envision sport utility models produced between May 16, 2017 and May 27, 2017. GM estimates that 45 percent of the cars named in the campaign contain the defective equipment.</p>\n<h3>The Defect</h3>\n<p>The vehicles mentioned in the recall could feature front head restraints that do not comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 202a, which mandates that all restraints <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2012-title49-vol6-sec571-202a.pdf\">attach securely to seat backs</a>, according to the U.S. Government Publishing Office. Buick Envision models come with backseat tablet computer holders that hook to the front seat head restraints. These devices could prevent restraints from fully engaging with seat backs, posing a serious safety hazard to drivers. However, GM has not received any accident or injury reports connected the defect.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>On March 21, 2017, a GM employee and Envision owners filed an internal report alleging that the tablet holder prevented the head restraint on his vehicle from connecting properly with the seat back. The car company launched an official investigation May 11. GM engineers corroborated the report with the dealer that had sold the vehicle. The dealership also confirmed the tablet holder had been installed in multiple Envision models, some of which had been sold.</p>\n<p>GM reviewed the instructions provided to dealers and discovered that they most likely caused confusion at the point of installation. Specifically, many technicians probably failed to remove the button caps located on the arms at the base of the head restraints, creating a situation in which these fixtures would not lock in place with the addition of the tablet holder.</p>\n<p>On May 17, the&nbsp;Brand Quality Manager for Buick notified dealers across the country of the problem and instructed them to remove restraint button caps when installing tablet holders. The GM Open Investigation Review evaluated the investigation and resulting fix June 5. On the June 8, the automaker&#8217;s Safety Field Action Decision Authority chose to conduct a voluntary non-compliance recall.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>GM has distributed updated installation instructions. Dealers will <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V404-8690.pdf\">reinstall the tablet holders</a> in affected vehicles, free of charge, according to the NHTSA.

Moisture may be able to enter the calipers and degrade the brake actuator shaft. This phenomenon, paired with continuous use, can increase the diameter of the shaft and inhibit its&nbsp;operability. In some instances, the shaft could become lodged within the brake caliper assembly and reduce parking brake stopping power. This poses a serious hazard to drivers, as the brake could suddenly disengage and cause an accidental collision.</p>\n<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>\n<p>In April 2015, Mazda received a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V393-6892.pdf\">field service report</a> from the Canadian market detailing an instance of brake drag, according to the NHTSA. Engineers inspected the vehicle involved, a Mazda6 sedan, and discovered that the actuator shaft in the rear brake caliper had seized. The automaker assumed that high pressure spraying around the caliper was the cause and instituted a field monitoring initiative to look for similar occurrences.</p>\n<p>In August, Mazda received seven field reports from the U.S. referencing that same problem. The carmaker initiated an investigation. Three months later, the company identified the root cause: improperly protected and corrosion-coated brake calipers. In December, Mazda engineers reviewed the original specifications for the brake caliper protective boot and tested its corrosion mitigation capabilities. Within the two months, the carmaker had introduced new protective boots at the point of assembly. However, this production change did not apply to Mazda6 sedans produced after January 2014, as Mazda had switched from mechanical braking systems to electric alternatives with more effective corrosion protections. The carmaker issued a similar decision on Mazda3 models, which featured an improved actuator shaft design.</p>\n<p>Over the summer of 2016, Mazda received multiple collision reports from the German and U.K. markets for Mazda3 and Mazda6&nbsp;models with corroded brake actuator shafts, including some that had rolled off of&nbsp;the assembly line after January 2014. In August, the company received an additional nine reports from dealers in the U.S. market and decided to take action. Throughout late 2016, the carmaker conducted an additional root cause investigation and worked on designs for new brake caliper protective boots.</p>\n<p>Mazda produced a boot replacement kit for the Mazda6 in January 2017. In February, the company introduced new manufacturing methods to address defective Mazda3 sedans. Three months later, it produced a boot replacement kit for this model. In May, the carmaker initiated a voluntary recall for both vehicles.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>Mazda will request dealers to survey the rear brake assemblies on vehicles named in the campaign and <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCAK-17V393-4088.pdf\">replace brake actuator shafts</a> that show signs of corrosion, free of charge, according to the NHTSA.

The campaign affects RX-8 <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RCLRPT-17V355-8262.PDF\">sports cars</a> manufactured between April 10, 2003 and May 7, 2004, according to documentation filed with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. The Japanese automaker is unsure what percentage of the vehicles named in the recall contain the damaged part.</p>\n<p><strong>The Defect</strong><br />\nAffected models are equipped with ball joints that have been improperly caulked and can therefore damage the joint socket. This structural instability puts immense pressure on the suspension and can even cause the joint to separate from the socket&nbsp;in affected vehicles that are bearing abnormally large loads. Such an event drastically decreases driveability &#8211; a symptom of loss of steering control &#8211; and compromises occupant safety.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong><br />\nIn December 2005, Mazda <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2017/RMISC-17V355-9826.pdf\">received a field report </a>from a dealer in the U.S. market mentioning the problem, according to a defect timeline filed with the NHTSA. While the automaker was unable to recover the failed part, it ultimately launched an official investigation to further explore the problem cited in the report. Quality assurance personnel closed the inquiry four months later without identifying the root cause. Mazda continued to monitor field reports to look for additional occurrences. In September 2007, the car maker received a report from the Japanese market in which the driver described losing steering power while racing. QA personnel started an official investigation.</p>\n<p>Engineers conducted tests between October and November of that year and determined that heavy loads were to blame in this instance of steering loss, after which Mazda resumed field monitoring. The company received two more reports from Japanese drivers between July and September of 2008, both of which detailed sudden steering failure during racing events. Engineers tested these vehicles and determined that the ball joints in both had fractured while the autos were&nbsp;supporting abnormally large loads. Mazda continued to monitor incoming field reports.</p>\n<p>The automaker received another field report during the summer of 2009. While the vehicle addressed in the complaint was not used for racing purposes, it did feature a performance suspension. Engineers determined that this fixture had nothing to do with the steering failure but noted it just the same. From October to December 2009, Mazda received two additional field reports pertaining to vehicles used in competition.</p>\n<p>Over the next two years, the number of field reports multiplied, most of which applied to RX-8s&nbsp;involved in racing events. Even so, the automaker did implement design changes in late 2012 to reduce the likelihood of steering loss. It also continued to investigate the problem and collect related field reports, eight of which materialized between 2013 and 2014.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2015, another driver in the Japanese market reported that his race-ready RX-8 had suddenly lost its steering power, forcing Mazda to resume more focused investigative efforts. Then, in June, an owner with no experience on the track filed a field report mentioning the problem. QA personnel for the car maker further analyzed ball joint separation in this non-racing model and restarted monitoring efforts to pinpoint other instances in which overloaded RX-8s used exclusively for commuting suffered steering control loss due to ball joint separation. From July to December 2015, Mazda conducted further tests.</p>\n<p>In January 2016, engineers for the car company began considering the possibility that the defect was not the result of race-related stress but a symptom of faulty assembly processes. Two months later, QA personnel conducted detailed examinations of existing production workflows. Between April and August 2016, Mazda continued this work and started developing field screening procedures for RX-8s already on the road. Over the course of September and October, these plans were finalized. By April 2017, engineers at the car company were fairly certain the problem was related to defective parts.</p>\n<p>On May 29, 2017, Mazda officials decided to launch a voluntary recall campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />\nThe automotive organization will order dealers to replace the lower control arms in affected RX-8s with new assemblies containing properly caulked ball joint sockets, free of charge. Mazda plans to notify owners July 15, 2017 and owners July 30, 2017.
