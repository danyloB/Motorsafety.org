The batteries may short circuit and potentially cause an engine fire. The recall includes <strong>Hyundai Kona 2019 and 2020 Electric </strong>vehicles (EV) and <strong>2020 Hyundai Ioniq EV</strong> sedans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a manufacturing error, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V127-1095.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the Li-ion batteries in these Hyundai Ioniq Electric and Hyundai Kona EVs may short-circuit and lead to an engine fire</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. recall is being conducted as part of a global recall announced by the manufacturer last month. Among the included countries is South Korea that recently launched its second recall on the back of at least 11 Kona EV fires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Fire reports</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RMISC-21V127-8743.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">three parked Hyundai Kona EV sedans caught on fire in Korea, two in Canada and one in Europe</a>. In each case, the parked vehicle had a full battery charge. Seven more fires were reported in 2020. In each case, Hyundai suspected that the fire was caused by an electrical short in the Li-ion battery. The cause of the issue was identified earlier this year and turned out to be incorrectly folded battery cells.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>South Korean recall and subsequent fire</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In October of last year, the manufacturer issued a recall South Korea for more than 25,000 Kona Electric vehicles due the risk of fire.

The driver may smell smoke or a burning/melting odor when a battery fire occurs. Additionally, the malfunction indicator (MIL) or the battery lights may come on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fire can injure occupants and a crash due to a fire may injure other drivers or pedestrians. <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/hyundai-recalls-over-120000-cars-over-faulty-engines-that-may-catch-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">For tips on what to do in the event of a fire, please refer to this recent article about a different Hyundai recall</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall is set to begin on April 30. In the short-term, the repair is a software update that the owners can conduct themselves or through their dealer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-term repair is for dealers to replace the Battery System Assembly (BSA). This work will be performed once parts are available.  It is important to note that<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-kona-ev-idUSKBN29V0CW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> the recalled Kona EV that caught fire in South Korea only received a software update,</a> but not the battery replacement, according to press reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the repair is completed, do NOT park your car inside. Instead, park it away from structures, including your home, garages and carports.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 4,600 vehicles are included in this Hyundai recall.

A power liftgate is a motorized trunk lid that opens and closes electronically. The recall includes <strong>2021 CX 30 </strong>Mazda SUVs<strong>, </strong>as well as the 2020 model year of the same car.

The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=21V086000\" target=\"_blank\">trunk lid can lower itself unexpectedly from a fully opened position</a>. This will only happen&nbsp; when the car is parked uphill facing the hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defect is caused by a supplier error, as well as “high ambient temperatures.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this defect is not supposed the liftgate to lower completely, there is still a risk of injury. This may happen when a person opens a liftgate and leans inside the trunk to gain access to stored objects. If the liftgate unexpectedly lowers during this period, he or she may hit it while standing back up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Mazda recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In June of last year, over 12,000 Mazda CX 30 2020 were recalled due to a fire risk caused by a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mazda-recalls-12000-cars-due-to-risk-of-crash-and-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">disconnected hose in the trunk</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, Mazda dealers will update the liftgate software and check serial numbers on drive units. If the units are found to be defective, they will be replaced. The repair is free of charge. The recall begins on April 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This Mazda recall includes 13,857 vehicles.

Call a tow truck or use your spare tire to drive to your mechanic to have the tire replaced.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Flat tires and belt separation can cause drivers to lose control and crash, particularly if they happen at high speeds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What to do if your tires blow out</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your tires blow out while driving, <a href=\"https://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle-Shoppers/Tires-Rating/General-Information-FAQ#q10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends the following</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stay calm and do your best to keep the vehicle balanced. </li><li>Do not slam on the brakes or suddenly take your foot off the accelerator. Both of these could cause you to lose control of the car. </li><li>Slowly ease off of the gas.</li><li>Gently “correct the steering&#8221; to regain control of the car.</li><li>Once the car is stable, continue to slow down until find a safe place to pull over and call for help.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers will inspect recalled vehicles’ tires to see if identifying numbers on the side match one of the seven defective tires. If they find one, they will replace it with a new tire. Inspections and replacements will be free and <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCMN-21V169-8637.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the spare tires should be “readily available.</a>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nissan will notify owners about the recall on April 28.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recent Nissan Altima and Continental tire recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2013-2018 Nissan Altimas were recalled in May of last year for an ongoing hood latch problem that has been the subject of three other recalls. According to Nissan, the issue has led to 16 “minor” crashes or injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Continental tires, this is the fourth recall over the last couple of months.&nbsp; Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/general-motors-recalls-over-33000-cars-over-risk-of-flat-tires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">General Motors recalled 33,000 vehicles due to this&nbsp; “overcuring” issue</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 127,000 vehicles are included in this Nissan recall.

The defect may cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash. The recall includes<strong> 2018 Mercedes GLE350</strong> luxury cars, <strong>2018 GLE43 AMG</strong> crossovers and <strong>2018 GLE400</strong> vehicles that operate with tires made by auto parts manufacturer Continental.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This recall is caused by defective tires that were reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) by Continental in February.&nbsp; <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V123-2427.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Due to a “process deviation,” the sidewall of the tire may break, causing a “sudden air loss”</a> in the tire. The break may also cause the tire tread – which is the part that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_tread\" target=\"_blank\">comes in contact with the road</a>– to separate from the tire.

The occupants of vehicles and pedestrians may be injured. The risks increase if the tire failure occurs at high speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Mercedes recalls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2018 GLE 350 luxury car has had recalls for wheels, brakes and other issues. For example, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-1-3-million-vehicles-that-may-call-emergency-services-to-wrong-place/\" target=\"_blank\">model was recently amongst 1.4 million Mercedes-Benz cars recalled because it may potentially lead first responders to the wrong place</a> when the car occupants need assistance after a crash. The issue was caused by a “disruption in the car’s power supply,” as reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Older GLE 350 model years were recently part of a recall involving over 40,000 luxury SUVs due to faulty stability control software. <a href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-luxury-suvs-due-to-faulty-stability-control-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A software error may result in these vehicles jerking to a side while trying to avoid a crash,&nbsp; ironically increasing the possibility of a collision</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the issue, dealers will inspect the tires and replace them as needed.

The problem is caused by an issue with the cars’ electronic stability control software, which helps drivers maintain control of the vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall includes 2020 and 2021 Mercedes GLE-&nbsp; and GLS-class cars, including&nbsp;the following models:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2020-2021 Mercedes&nbsp;GLE350&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2020-2021 Mercedes&nbsp;GLE450&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Mercedes&nbsp;GLE580&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Mercedes GLE450&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>2020 Mercedes GLS580&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These vehicles operate with an <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.motorsafety.org/mercedes-benz-recalls-high-performance-cars-with-faulty-stability-control-software/\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Stability Control system (ESP), which “ensures that the car moves in the direction it wants to go</a>”, as reported.

In December 2019, a single 2020 Mercedes Benz GLE450 4matic vehicle needed to be taken in for repair for insufficient padding on some of the headrests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting pulled to a side can result in a crash which may hurt the occupants of the car, other drivers and pedestrians.
