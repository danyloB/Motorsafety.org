The front trunk may open while driving.</p>\n","description":"\n<p><em>Pleasanton, CA – August 18, 2020</em> – General Motors (NYSE:GM) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=20V489\" target=\"_blank\">has recalled</a> 7,071 Chevrolet Corvette vehicles whose controls fail to prevent them from developing high speeds despite an unlatched front trunk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trunk may then open while driving, increasing the risk of a crash. The recall includes <strong>2020 Chevrolet Corvette vehicles.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Recall summary&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the lack of safety controls, these vehicles can develop high speeds despite having the front trunk unlatched.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cause is multifold. First, thanks to a design flaw, drivers can accidentally press the front trunk release button on their key fob. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the cars’ internal controls fail to limit the speed&nbsp; &#8211; allowing the vehicle to reach up to 82 miles-per-hour (mph) &#8211; despite detecting that the trunk is not securely closed.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drivers will still receive audible and visual alerts telling them that the trunk is open.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens when the driver speeds up?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the car reaches a higher speed, air resistance may force open the unlatched hood, blocking the <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V489-9407.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">driver’s front view</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Risks&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not being able to see in front of the vehicle creates a&nbsp; very high risk of a crash. The driver may not see traffic down the road and hit a vehicle from behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent that from happening, drivers should pay attention to their warning system. When the hood is not properly latched, the driver will receive two different types of warnings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will first see an icon indicating an open hood on the instrument panel and hear a chime. Once the vehicle is put in drive and moves faster than 3 mph, the chime sounds repeatedly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of the warnings, the vehicle can be driven up to 82 mph with the hood unlatched. As the driver speeds up, air resistance may force open the unlatched hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The repair</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GM’s upcoming software update will <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCSB-20V489-7507.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">limit</a> the affected vehicle’s speed to 26 mph when the hood is not latched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manufacturer <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V489-9407.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">is also going to re-design</a> both the key fob and&nbsp; the “door trim switch and release button” inside the hood to reduce the risk of a driver inadvertently opening the hood with the fob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The repair is expected to begin October 3, and is free of charge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 7,000 vehicles are included in this Chevrolet recall.

The car uses a magnet-coated wheel to keep the engine in sync.

Vehicles may not be able to react in time and could ram a stalled car from behind. Even if the driver safely gets to the shoulder, they are still at risk of being hit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your car stalls, turn on the emergency hazard lights. If you can do so safely, try to <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-maintenance/what-to-do-when-your-car-stalls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">shift into neutral</a> and maneuver your car to the side of the road. Call&nbsp; your roadside assistance provider and be sure to <strong>stay in the car</strong>.

The frozen cables cannot move properly, which could keep the door from fully latching shut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second time the manufacturer conducts a recall for the same issues.  As a result of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=18V795000\" target=\"_blank\">first recall,</a> Honda replaced the door latches, but some vans’ doors <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V437-4397.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">continued</a> to slide open while driving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue has not resulted in injuries or crashes but there have been 31 incidents so far, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V437-4397.PDF\">according to Honda.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Risks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a car door suddenly opens while a vehicle is moving it poses a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RMISC-20V437-2118.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">safety hazard</a> to occupants who could fall out of the car. Falls from vehicles account for 17% of all non-crash vehicle fatalities, according to a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812120\" target=\"_blank\">2015 report</a> by the National Highway Transit Safety Administration (NHTSA).
