The recall includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2008-2010 Chrysler Town &amp; Country</strong></li><li><strong>2008-2010 Dodge Grand Caravan</strong></li><li><strong>2007-2011 Dodge Nitro</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recall summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The plastic brand emblem on the steering wheel, as well as the nuts securing it, form part of the airbag cover. As a result of a design flaw, these components <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCMN-20V396-7736.pdf\">may detach and injure </a>the driver and passengers, especially if the driver airbag deploys&nbsp; during a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Safety risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 14 known injuries caused by this defect. One <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=10605353\">report</a> filed in 2013 with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) describes how one man received a “huge laceration” from a Dodge emblem that was flung into his forearm during a crash. “It could have knocked out his eye, entered his heart or even slashed his throat,” his spouse said in the report. Another near miss <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=10434434\">was reported</a> in 2011, when an Oregon driver noticed, after a crash, that the emblem on her 2007 Dodge Nitro had shot off the steering wheel when the airbags went off and ended up in the passenger-side door. The driver was concerned with how forcefully the emblem had flown off the wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005189/#2e82077a-360f-454c-8570-f0841848ecf0:~:text=The%20airbag%20system%20is%20delicately%20designed,within%20a%20period%20of%2030%2D50%20ms%2C\">Airbags deploy</a> at speeds between 100 and 200 miles per hour within 30 to 50 milliseconds. Additionally, “objects in the path of a deploying airbag can become injurious, potentially lethal projectiles.” Even without the boost of an airbag, any loose object in a crashing vehicle can impale an occupant <a href=\"https://www.hoganinjury.com/when-loose-objects-become-high-speed-projectiles-in-a-car-crash/\">at close to the speed </a>the vehicle was going before it crashed. For example, in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4520032/\">surgeons in Rhode Island</a> found a dime lodged in a crash victim’s leg. It had passed through his femur. The dime was bent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Repair</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FCA intends to replace the driver airbag cover on all affected vehicles. Replacements are <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCMN-20V396-5559.pdf\">set to be available</a> by September. In the meantime, FCA <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCRIT-20V396-7110.pdf\">has offered</a> to remove emblems from the airbag cover as an “interim repair.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is your vehicle part of this recall?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 900,000 cars are included in this Fiat Chrysler recall.
